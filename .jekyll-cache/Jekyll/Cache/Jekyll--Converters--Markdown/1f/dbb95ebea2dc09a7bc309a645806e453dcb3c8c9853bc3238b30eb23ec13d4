I"‘<p>Last night I was studying about management and this thought came into my mind. Insights most often occur when the thoughts are not directly focus on the problem at hand, strange huh, but true.</p>

<p>Why do people get angry? why does relationships break? and many more questions like this. So many questions and you only have one answer to all these questions, â€˜EXPECTATIONâ€™.</p>

<p>Relationship travels along theÂ smoother side of the road until this,Â  Expectaion,Â calamity hits it.Â  Relationship always sees the smoother side of the road initially so why does it gets bitter later? This is because we do not have much EXPECATION initially. So why do we expect later? Even I donâ€™t have an answer to this question. And I am in search of one too <img src="http://www.ajaymatharu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
