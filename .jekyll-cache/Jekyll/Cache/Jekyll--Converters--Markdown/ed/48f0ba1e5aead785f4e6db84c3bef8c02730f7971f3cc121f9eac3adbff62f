I"Ù<p>The system, called KERS for Kinetic Energy Recovery Systerms, is designer to capture energy from the carâ€™s movement and reuse it in power bursts instead of fuel. It is a key element in Formula Oneâ€™s attempt to become a more energy-efficient and technologically and socially releveant sport.</p>

<p>KERS allows team to take energy generated under braking, store it, and use it again for concentrated burst. The KERS will be mandatory in Formula One from 2009. It isÂ  a step towards making Formula One cars hybrid and more environment friendly by 2013.Â  There are two technical solutions to KERS â€“ mechanical and electrical. A mechanical KERS uses a flywheel to retain power under braking; an electrical system, uses an electric motor. More powerful KERS will be allowed from 2011, and operate on all four wheels from 2013.</p>

<p>While some support the KERS, which will make Formula One cars more environment friendly, some are quite reluctant to introduce the system.</p>
