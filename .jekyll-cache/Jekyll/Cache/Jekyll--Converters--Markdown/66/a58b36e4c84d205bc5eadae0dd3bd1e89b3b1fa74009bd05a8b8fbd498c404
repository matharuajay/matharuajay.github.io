I"ƒ<p>SHANGHAI : The unveiling of Apples iPad tablet computer was one of the most anticipated technology events in recent years, but a similar looking device has been on sale in China for nearly six months.</p>

<p>The touchscreen iPad look-alike marks a new milestone by Chinese manufacturers: cloning a product before it had even been announced, mused Shanghaiist.com, a city blog, and Shanzhai.com, a tech blog dedicated to Chinese copies.</p>

<p>But Shenzhen Great Loong Brother Industrial Co makers of the Chinese device, which resembles an over-sized iPhone said Apple appeared to be the copycats.</p>

<p>We dont understand. Why did they make the same thing as us said Huang Xiaofang, an executive at the company.</p>

<p>The iPad-like P88 was launched in August and was on show last year at the Internationale Funkausstellung consumer electronics fair in Berlin, she said. We launched it earlier.</p>

<p>Although thicker and heavier than the iPad, the P88s specifications boasts a slightly larger screen, faster processor, larger memory and, unlike the iPad, has USB ports, according to the manufacturer.</p>

<p>But its battery life is only 1.5 hours compared to the iPads 10 hours. Apples first iPads will ship worldwide at an entry-level price of $499 (Rs 23,000 approx) in two months. But for gadget fanatics who cannot wait, Huang said the P88 is available now on Great Loong Brothers Web site.</p>
