I"g<p>Last night I just saw this and thought of sharing it with everyone.</p>

<p><strong>– CLARIFY YOUR PURPOSE AND IDENTIFY YOUR STRENGTS</strong></p>

<p>Your ideal life cannot be found in your weaknesses – live in your strengts.</p>

<p><strong>-DEVELOP YOUR TOP STRENGTHS</strong></p>

<p>Become the best at what you do best – people will respect and pay for the best.</p>

<p><strong>– ACCEPT WHERE YOU ARE AS YOUR STARTING POINT</strong></p>

<p>If you let go of the PAST and embrace your PRESENT, your FUTURE is yours to choose.</p>

<p><strong>– SOLVE PROBLEMS AND RESOLVE PAST CONFLICTS</strong></p>

<p>To sail off to a new destination, you must pull up all the anchors in your life.</p>

<p><strong>– INVEST 10% OF YOUR TIME FOR YOUR FUTURE</strong></p>

<p>If you plan to stumble on your ideal life, stumble you will.</p>

<p><strong>– IDENTIFY AND BUILD UP YOUR MARGINS</strong></p>

<p>Ideal lifes are lived in the ‘margins’ – with them you have The Law of Attraction.</p>

<p><strong>– REMOVE DRILLS AND REPAIR YOUR BUCKETS</strong></p>

<p>For your ideal life to hold water, you have to eliminate negative infulences.</p>

<p><strong>– SURROUND YOURSELF WITH POSITIVE INFLUENCES</strong></p>

<p>You must build your ideal environment, before you can build your ideal life.</p>

<p><strong>– REVIEW AND RE-COMMIT OFTEN</strong></p>

<p>Success is a journey, not a destination. Always be ready to adapt to new options.</p>

<p><strong>– ATTEND WORKSHOPS AND POLISH YOUR DIAMOND</strong></p>

<p>We all are diamonds in the rough, in need of regular cleaning and maintainance from professionals.</p>
