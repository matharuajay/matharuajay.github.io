  In an attempt to get more users, Microsoft has added <a href="http://www.getsearchperks.com/Status.aspx?campaignid=perks&amp;statusid=2101"><span style="color:#92a3b1;">SearchPerks</span></a> to its <a href="http://www.live.com/"><span style="color:#41627c;">Live Search</span></a> service.

  But, unless you have Internet Explorer 6.0, you arenâ€™t even able to access the SearchPerks registration form. Yep. In order to test out SearchPerks you need to have IE 6 or higher. Thatâ€™s a deal breaker right there.

  With only a <a href="http://www.techweb.com/financialCenter/index.jhtml?Account=techweb&amp;Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=MSFT"><span style="color:#41627c;">9% market share</span></a> compared with <a href="http://www.techweb.com/financialCenter/index.jhtml?Account=techweb&amp;Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=GOOG"><span style="color:#41627c;">Googleâ€™s 60%</span></a>, Microsoft refuses to give up on the search market. And you have to admire that fact â€“ despite the failed Yahoo acquisition (which Google sidled up and snagged), itâ€™s full steam ahead! Microsoft will not quit â€“ but it will pay you to use Live Search.

  So what is SearchPerks? Registered users agree to download a usage tracking program and then earn one ticket per every Live Search query (up to 25 tickets per day) until the program ends in April. Users can then redeem their tickets for prizes or donate the rewards to charity.

  As interesting as it sounds, the SearchPerks registration page has a bit of a late-night infomercial feel to it. Things like â€œthe sooner you sign up, the more opportunity you have to earn tickets!â€ are reminiscent of the â€œact now to receive your second <a href="http://www.buythebullet.com/"><span style="color:#41627c;">Magic Bullet</span></a> completely free!â€ But then again, perks persuade people to buy (or in this case, <em>be</em> bought).

<p class="MsoNormal">
  By offering up SearchPerks to attract users, has Microsoft inadvertently proved Googleâ€™s strength? The search engine should speak for itself, no gimmicks necessary.
