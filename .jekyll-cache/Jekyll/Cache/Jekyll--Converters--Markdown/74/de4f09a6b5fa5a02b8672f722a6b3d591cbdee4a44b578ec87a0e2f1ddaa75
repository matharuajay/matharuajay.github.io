<p>The Hindu festival of lights explodes into life with a riot of color and noise. A variety show and a fireworks display kicked off the Diwali celebrations. The festivals like Diwali remind us of the brilliant display of colorful fireworks which explode in the dark nights. The cities are famous for these. Nowadays, as a step to curb pollution from firecrackers and save the expenses, common community display of fireworks are becoming increasingly popular. Here, we will see how these fireworks originated. Fireworks and crackers are used the world over, only the occasion differs in different countries.</p>

<p>This festival of fun, frolic and fireworks brings excitement and joy to the hearts of people even before it arrives on the new moon day <strong>(Amavasya)</strong> of the <strong>Kartik month</strong> of the Hindu calendar. Diwali is also the festival of Laxmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth and prosperity. Traditionally people use <strong>‘earthen lamps’</strong> with cotton wicks and oil to light up the dark night. As man progresses, tradition gives way to modernity. Similarly, earthen lamps have been replaced by the candles of various colors and forms. Electric lights of different shapes and sizes illuminate the dark, often cold nights of Diwali.</p>

<p>Diwali is incomplete without fireworks. Old and young alike love the splendor and sparkle of fireworks. The earthen lamps that we light on Diwali night are generally placed on balcony and window ledges. So ensure that these are not near any flammable material like wood, cloth or paper. Do not leave lamps and candles burning all through the night long after the festivities are over. This can create a dangerous situation. Hence it is advisable that all lamps and candles are put off when nobody is likely to be around. Twinkling anaars, rockets whizzing past, dazzling fireworks exploding in the skies above… it’s sheer dynamite!</p>
