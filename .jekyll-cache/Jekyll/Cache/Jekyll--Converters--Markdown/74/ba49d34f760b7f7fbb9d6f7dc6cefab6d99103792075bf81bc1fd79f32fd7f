  We have something called as Fun Friday&#8217;s in our office we normally celebrate that every alternate friday. What we do in that is play games and enjoy. All it does is it keeps you fresh and agile its one of the most happening thing in my office. And the games are based on the theme or some festival which is goin on or which is awaited. The winning team is presented with choclates.
