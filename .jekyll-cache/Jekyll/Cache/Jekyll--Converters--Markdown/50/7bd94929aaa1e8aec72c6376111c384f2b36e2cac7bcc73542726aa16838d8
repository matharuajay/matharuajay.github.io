I"%<p>I just saw this story and felt like sharing this with you guys, its about how Lord himself thinks that Government is over Lord,</p>

<p>In the year 2008, the Lord came unto Noah,</p>

<p>who was now living in the United States, and said:</p>

<p>“Once again, the earth has become wicked and over</p>

<p>-populated, and I see the end of all flesh before me.”</p>

<p>“Build another Ark and save 2 of every <span class="yshortcuts">living thing</span></p>

<p>along with a few good humans.”</p>

<p>He gave Noah the blueprints, saying:</p>

<p>“You have 6 months to build the Ark before I will</p>

<p>start the unending rain for 40 days and 40 nights.”</p>

<p>Six months later, the Lord looked down and saw Noah</p>

<p>weeping in his yard – but no Ark.</p>

<p>“Noah!,” He roared, “I’m about to start the rain!</p>

<p>Where is the Ark?”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Lord,” begged Noah, “but things have changed.”</p>

<p>“I needed a building permit.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been arguing with the inspector</p>

<p>about the need for a sprinkler system.”</p>

<p>“My neighbors claim that I’ve violated the</p>

<p>neighborhood zoning laws by building the Ark in my</p>

<p>yard and exceeding the height limitations. We had to</p>

<p>go to the Development Appeal Board for a decision.”</p>

<p>“Then the <span class="yshortcuts">Department of Transportation</span> demanded a</p>

<p>bond be posted for the future costs of moving power</p>

<p>lines and other overhead obstructions, to clear the</p>

<p>passage for the Ark’s move to the sea. I told them</p>

<p>that the sea would be coming to us, but they would</p>

<p>hear nothing of it.”</p>

<p>“Getting the wood was another problem. There’s a ban</p>

<p>on cutting local trees in order to save the <span class="yshortcuts">spotted owl</span>.”</p>

<p>“I tried to convince the environmentalists that I</p>

<p>needed the wood to save the owls – but no go!”</p>

<p>“When I started gathering the animals, an animal</p>

<p>rights group sued me. They insisted that I was</p>

<p>confining <span class="yshortcuts" style="cursor:hand;border-bottom:#0066cc 1px dashed;">wild animals</span> against their will. They</p>

<p>argued the accommodations were too restrictive, and</p>

<p>it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in</p>

<p>a confined space.”</p>

<p>“Then the EPA ruled that I couldn’t build the Ark</p>

<p>until they’d conducted an environmental impact study</p>

<p>on your proposed flood.”</p>

<p>“I’m still trying to resolve a complaint with the</p>

<p><span class="yshortcuts">Human Rights Commission</span> on how many minorities I’m</p>

<p>supposed to hire for my building crew.”</p>

<p>“Immigration and Naturalization are checking the</p>

<p>green-card status of most of the people who want to work.”</p>

<p>“The trades unions say I can’t use my sons. They</p>

<p>insist I have to hire only Union workers with</p>

<p>Ark-building experience.”</p>

<p>“To make matters worse, the IRS seized all my assets,</p>

<p>claiming I’m trying to leave the country illegally</p>

<p>with <span class="yshortcuts">endangered species</span>.”</p>

<p>“So, forgive me, Lord, but it would take at least 10</p>

<p>years for me to finish this Ark.”</p>

<p>“Suddenly the skies cleared, the sun began to shine,</p>

<p>and a rainbow stretched across the sky.”</p>

<p>Noah looked up in wonder and asked,</p>

<p>“You mean you’re not going to destroy the world?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Lord.</p>

<p>“The GOVERNMENT beat me to it.”</p>
