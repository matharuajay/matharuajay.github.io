I"Í<p>This is one of the wonderful articles i have read,Â </p>

<p>Before we were born, a whole society of storytellers was already here. The storytellers who were here before us taught us how to be human. First they told us what we are a boy or a girl, then they told us who we are, and who we should or shouldnâ€™t be. They taught us how to be a woman or how to be a man, They told us to be a proper woman, a decent woman, a strong man, a brave man. They gave us a name, and they told us the role we would play in their story. They prepared us to live in the human jungle, to compete with one another; to impose our will, to fight against our own kind. They filled us with knowledge, and of course we believed them. From the storytellers around us, we learned how to create our own story.</p>

<p>By exploring the story that we create, I discovered that the story has a voice. You can call it â€œThinkingâ€ if you want. I call it â€œthe voice of knowledgeâ€ because itâ€™s telling you everything you know. itâ€™s always trying to make sense out of everything. That voice is always there. ItÂ  never stops. Itâ€™s not even real, but you here it. You can say, â€˜well itâ€™s me. Iâ€™m the one who is talking.â€™ but if you are the voice that is talking, then who is listening?</p>

<p>The voice of knowledge can also be called as liar who lives in your head. The liar speaks in your langauage, but your spirit, the truth, has no language. You just know truth; you feel it. The voice of your spirit tries to come out, but the voice of the liar is stronger and louder and it hooks your attention almost all of the time. You hear the voice, and what is it telling you? â€˜Look at you. Who do you think you are? You will never make it. You arenâ€™t smart enough. Why should i try? Nobody understands me. How can i be happy when millions of people are dying of starvation?â€</p>

<p>That voice is usually lying because itâ€™s the voice of what you have learned, and you have learned so many lies, mainly about yourself. The voice of knowledge can come from your own head, or it can come from people around you, but your emotional reaction to that voice is telling you, â€œIâ€™m being abused.â€™ Every time we judge ourself, find ourselves guilty, and punish ourselves, Itâ€™s because the voice in our head is telling us lies. Every time we have a conflict with our parents, our children , or our beloved, itâ€™s because we believe in lies, and they believe in them, too.</p>

<p>But itâ€™s not just that. When we believe in lies, we cannot see the truth, so we make thousands of assumptions and we take them as truth. One of the biggest assumptions we make is that the lies we believe are the truth!</p>

<p>Two thousand years ago, one of the greatest masters said, â€˜And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.â€™ Free from what? From the storeyteller who lives in your head and talks to you all the time. when you no longer have that voice in your head, i can assure you that itâ€™sÂ  wonderful when the voice in your head finally stops talking. You experience inner peace.</p>

<p>That voice has been in control of your head for so many years, and no, it wonâ€™t give up just because you want it to leave you alone. But at least you can challenge it by not believing what it tells you.</p>

<p>if you follow these two rules, all the lies that come from the voice of knowledge wonâ€™t survive your skepticism and will simply disappear.</p>

<p>Rule number one; Dontâ€™t believe yourself. Listen to your story, but dontâ€™t believe it because now you know that itâ€™s mostly fiction. When you hear the voice in your head, donâ€™t take it personally.</p>

<p>Rule number two: Donâ€™t believe anybody else. You know that if you lie to yourslef, surely other people lie to themselves, And if they lie to themselves, they will lie to you also.</p>

<p>You can change your life by refusing to believe your own lies. Start with the main lies that limit the expression of your happiness and your love. If you take your faith away from the lies, they lose their power over you. Then you can recover your faith and invest it in different beliefs. If you stop believing in liesÂ  your whole life changes just like magic, You will be free of fear, drama, and conflict. this is absolute truth.</p>
