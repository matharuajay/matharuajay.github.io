I"†<p>You could be walking and suddenly see a lemon and some greeen chillies tied to a string lying on the road. Your first instinct is to avoid it. You may not even stop to think why you are avoiding it. You just do. If you take a moment to consider what you believe, is just an old wives tale or superstition that lime and chillies lying on the road have been used to ward off bad luck.</p>
