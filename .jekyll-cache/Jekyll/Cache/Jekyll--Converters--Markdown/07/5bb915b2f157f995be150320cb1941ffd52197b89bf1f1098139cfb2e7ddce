  <p>“The fragrance always stays in the hand that gives the rose.”</p>

  <p>– Heda Bejar</p>

<p>When you do something nice for someone, when you do them a favor, or when you give them a gift, you will get something back. This is true even if you are not expecting to receive anything back from them. The Universe/God/Spirit/Consciousness/You (whatever you want to call it) feels your gratitude in you and will return it to you.</p>

<p>It is like the old saying, “<strong>What goes around, Comes around.</strong>” You may give someone a rose, but the fragrance of your gift literally remains on you.</p>

<p>When you think good thoughts, good things will happen to you. When you express your gratitude, more will be provided to you for which you can be grateful.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful cycle.</p>

<p>Be Well.</p>
