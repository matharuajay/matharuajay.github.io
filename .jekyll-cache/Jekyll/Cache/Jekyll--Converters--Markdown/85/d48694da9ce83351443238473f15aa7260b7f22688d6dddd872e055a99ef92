<p>**Lacing Technique:</p>

<p>** 1. The lace is run straight across the bottom (grey section) and emerges through both bottom eyelets.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The ends are twisted together with one complete twist in the middle of the shoe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ends then continue across to the opposite sides, where they go under and out through the next set of eyelets up the shoe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat steps (2) and (3) until both ends reach the top eyelets.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>**Lacing Technique:</p>

<p>** 1. The lace is run straight across the bottom (grey section) and emerges through both bottom eyelets.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The laces then go straight up and are fed into the next set of eyelets up the shoe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ends are crossed over and are fed <em>under</em> the vertical lace section on the opposite sides of the shoe before going straight up and into the next set of eyelets up the shoe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the top set of eyelets, the laces can once again cross over and pass under the straight section</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Lattice Lacing </span></p>

<p>**Lacing Technique – Method 1 – Shorter Laces:</p>

<p>** 1. The lace runs straight across the bottom (grey section) and emerges from both bottom eyelets.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Cross the ends over and feed into the 4th set of eyelets up the shoe <em>(skip past 2 sets of eyelets)</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both ends now run straight up and emerge from the 5th set of eyelets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cross the ends over and feed into the 2nd set of eyelets up the shoe <em>(skip past 2 sets of eyelets)</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both ends now run straight up and emerge from the 3rd set of eyelets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cross the ends over, feed under and emerge from the top set of eyelets</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>**Lacing Technique – Method 2 – Longer Laces:</p>

<p>** 1. The lace runs straight across the bottom (grey section) and emerges from both bottom eyelets.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Cross the ends over and feed into the 4th set of eyelets up the shoe <em>(skip past 2 sets of eyelets)</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both ends now run straight down and emerge from the 2nd set of eyelets <em>(skip past 1 set of eyelets)</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat steps (2) and (3), crossing over and feeding into the 5th set of eyelets, then straight down to emerge from the 3rd set of eyelets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the lacing by crossing over, feeding under and emerging from the top set of eyelets.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Checkerboard Lacing </span></p>

<p>**Lacing Technique:</p>

<p>** 1. Start with two pairs of different colour laces, preferably the wide, flat variety. (I was lucky to receive two such pairs with my last sneakers!)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>With one colour (orange in my diagram), lace the shoe using Straight (Easy) Lacing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the other colour (purple in my diagram), start at the bottom of the shoe and weave the lace in and out of the other lace until you reach the top.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fold around the top lace and head back down, weaving out and in until you reach the bottom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continue across the shoe until you’re out of room or out of lace, whichever comes first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tuck all the loose ends of the laces into the shoe.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
