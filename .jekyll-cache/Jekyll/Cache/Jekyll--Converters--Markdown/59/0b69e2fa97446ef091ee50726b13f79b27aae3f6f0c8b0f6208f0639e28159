I",<p>Hi guys, do you know you can use already ready code inside your visual studio? Yes certainly you can insert code snippets into your code. You can invoke the “Insert Snippet” by using shortcut “ctrl k + ctrl x”.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694" title="snippet" src="http://ajaymatharu.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/snippet.jpg" alt="snippet" width="500" height="221" /></p>

<p>You can download some of the code snippets from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718338.aspx all you need to do is install this file at “My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets” location. You can also find some more snippets at http://www.codeplex.com/snippetlibcsharp/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=14841 all you need to do is copy this snippet at “My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets” and you are ready to use these ready made code into your visual studio using shortcuts “ctrl k + ctrl x”</p>

<p>You can also insert the snippets by writing a part of it and pressing tab twice. For e.g. to insert a new property in your code type</p>

<p>prop + tab + tab</p>

<p>this will insert a property in your code window.</p>

<p>So keep using this to improve your productivity, and enjoy coding.</p>
