I"ð<p>Turns out, in Word 2007 all you have to do is use =lorem() instead of =rand() and youâ€™ll be able to insert the lorem text instead.</p>

<p>Just type in =lorem() into your document, and hit the enter keyâ€¦</p>

<p>And just like that, Lorem Ipsum is inserted automatically!</p>

<p>Just like the other tip, you can use the following syntax:</p>

<p>=lorem(paragraphs,sentences)</p>

<p>For instance, for 6 paragraphs of 20 sentences each, you would use:</p>

<p>=lorem(6,20)</p>
