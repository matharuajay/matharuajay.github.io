I"ì<p>Do you find yourself forcing a brittle smile and staring awkwardly when someone tells you about their achievements? Does your heart do triple flips whenÂ  a friend is catapulted into the limelight? here is how you can handle those negative emotions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <div>
  Compare yourself only with your own achievements. Charter your growth by contrasting your present quality of living with your past, not someone else&#8217;s.

  Psychologists feel that envious people often lose their own dynamism by conveting opportunities that fall into other people&#8217;s laps. Be focused in the pursuit of your goals. Go only after those dreams that are important to you and do not let someone else&#8217;s success sway you from your own path.

  if your are feeling envious of a close friend or relative, list the qualities they possess that attracted your attention. Reflect on how you can acquire those characteristics as well. What steps would you take? Not only will this transform your own personality, but your jealousy too will disintegrate.

    <div>
  Build your self-confidence. Attend etiquette classes, make new friends and engage in a an exctiting hobby you love. If you embark on a continual process of self-discovery. you will neither have the time nor inclination to be envious of others.

    <div>
  Look at an isssue from all perspectives and understand what really triggers your enthusiasm. For instance, you might admire working women, but would you actually be happy stepping into their shoes? They sacrifice their leisure time with long hours at the office and are possibly dead tired and unable to spend enough time with their own children. Understand your own needs in depth. Look beyound the surface gloss of every issue and you will find that, sometimes, your envy may be unwarranted.
</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
  Interact with people less fortunate than yourself. You will learn to appreciate your own blessings. If there always seems to be someone better off than you, ,remember, there are plenty in worse situations too. As the saying goes, &#8216;I wept because I had no shoes, until i saw a man with no feet.&#8217;
