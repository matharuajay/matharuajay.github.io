  It is quite easy to get approval if we ask enough people, or if we ask those who are likely to tell us what we want to hear. The likelihood is that they will say nice things rather than be too critical. Also, we tend to edit out the bad so that we hear only what we want to hear.

  So if you have produced a pleasantly acceptable piece of work, you will have proved to yourself that itâ€™s good simply because others have said so. It is probably ok. But then itâ€™s probably not great either. If, instead of seeking approval, you ask, â€˜Whatâ€™s wrong with it? How can I make it better?â€™, you are more likely to get a truthful, critical answer.
