I"<p>Microsoft has launched an app for Apple’s iPhone. Microsoft and Apple are traditional rivals in the operating systems market, but that has not prevented the world’s largest software company from launching an application for the iPhone.</p>

<p>Seadragon Mobile is free to download from Apple’s iTunes App Store and gives users the ability to access online photo libraries either using the phone’s 3G or Wi-Fi connection.</p>

<p>These include images available of Microsoft’s Photosynth site, which allows users to stitch together hundred of digital photographs to create a 3D image that can then be looked at from all angles, or even viewed in close-up detail.</p>

<p>The apps also offers an RSS feed so users can be notified when new content is made available.</p>
