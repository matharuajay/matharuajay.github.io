I"â<p>People do business with people who make them feel good. Human beings are creatures of emotions. We want to be with those who make us feel happy and special and cared for and safe.</p>

<p>Being good is being wise. Make people feel good about doing business with you or being with you. Youâ€™ll lead the field. Youâ€™ll have fun doing it. And itâ€™s just the right thing to do.</p>

<p>â€œDo good and leave behind a virtue that the storm of time can never destroy.â€</p>

<p>Itâ€™s very important how you make people feel. Because itâ€™s not your words that affect the relations itâ€™s how you make them feel. And everyone wants others to make us happy and special and cared for, so ifÂ  you expect this start giving more of this.</p>
