I"æ<p>The U.K.â€™s advertising regulator banned a video advertisement for Appleâ€™s 3G iPhone, saying Wednesday that the ad exaggerates the phoneâ€™s speed and is misleading.</p>

<p>The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 17 complaints about the advertisement, which shows a person whizzing through tasks such as opening a news page in a browser, using Google Maps and downloading a file.</p>

<p>All of the tasks â€œhad waiting times of only a fraction of a second,â€ the ASA said in a statement. A voice over says no less than five times that the 3G iPhone is â€œreally fast.â€</p>

<p>In response, Apple told the ASA that the claim is a comparison between the 3G and 2G iPhone models, and that users would understand that performance could vary. The ad did include a text disclaimer that read â€œNetwork performance will vary by location.â€</p>

<p>However, the ASA found that the snappy visuals combined with the repetition of â€œreally fastâ€ would â€œlead viewers to conclude that the device actually operated at or near to the speeds shown in the ad.â€</p>

<p>Also, not all mobile phone users may be aware of the differences between 2G and 3G technology, ASA said.</p>

<p>Apple did not have an immediate comment on the ruling.</p>
