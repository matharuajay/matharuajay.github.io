I"w<p>While there is a broad awareness of the concept of mind over matter, do we know where the mind is actually located? Our bodies, our thoughts and emotions, truly mirror each other. When our mind is at peace, our bodies look relaxed. Equally, when we are physically hurt, we become more prone to experiencing unpleasant feelings.Â If our thoughts and emotions, comprising the mind, are located int he brain, how does our body reflect what we are thinking? Is it possible that our minds reside throughout the body and not just in the brain? There has nowbeen extensive research on the presense on fhte mind in our entire body that suggests that the neuropeptides, molecules of our emotions, are present not just in the brain but everywhere in the body. While the brain remains the primary analyzer; our mind is not located there and is instead more like an information-processing field spread across the body. Every cell in our body is capable of feeling and expressing emotion. No wonder then, sometimes after undergoing an organ transplant, people notice sudden changes in their thoughts and emotions based on the patterns of the donor.</p>
