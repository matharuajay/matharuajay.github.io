I"^<p>As the Health Ministry prepares to enforce a ‘smoke-free workplace policy’ from October 2, a petition challening the ban is up for hearing on September 30</p>

<p>The rule says;</p>

<p>– No person smokes in work places, shopping malls, and cinema theatres.</p>

<p>– Public spaces have to specifically display a board stating  ‘No smoking area – smoking here is an offence’ in English and other Indian Languages. Separate boards to be displayed at every entrance/floor.</p>

<p>– No ashtrays, matches, lighters to be provided in work places, shopping malls and cinema theatres.</p>

<p>– If owners fail to penalise smokers, they have to pay up fines equal to number of offences. The fine is Rs200 for each individual offence, but there’s a move to raise that to Rs1,000</p>

<p>Now the question is WILL WE GET SMOKE FREE WORKPLACES?</p>
