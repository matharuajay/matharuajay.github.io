Top new features in SQL 2008

**&#8211; Use Resource Governor to manage concurrent workloads.**

Ensure consistent performance by using Resource Governor to define resource limits and priorities for different workloads and enable consistent performance.

**&#8211; Enforce policy compliance consistently across the enterprise with the Declarative Management Framwork.**

Manage your enterprise data infrastructure easily with Declarative Management Framework (DMF). Reduce the time spent on daily maintenance operations by defining a common set of policies for most database operations like query optimizations, naming conventions, backup and restore operations, and index management. Apply policies to many servers for consistent management across the enterprise.

**&#8211; Reduce storage requirements and increase query performance with data compression and sparse columns.**

Reduce your storage costs and improve performance of large I/O bound workloads by using data compression

&#8211; **Protect sensitive data with Transparent Data Encryption and advanced auditing.**

Dynamically encrypt your valuable data within an entire database, data files, or log files, without the need for applying application changes. Minimize exposure for security attacks by using Surface Area Configuration to enable only the services you require.

**&#8211; Troubleshoot, tune and monitor SQL 2008 instances across the enterprise with Performance System Analysis.**

Enable Performance System Analysis by collecting performance data from your system and storeit in a centralized data repository. View reports to benchmark and analyze system performance and health.

**&#8211; Build high performance analysis solutions with scalability, performance, data mining, and user interface enhancements in SQL Analysis Services.**

Drive business intelligence throughout your organization, manage reports and analysis of any size of complexity and empower user by providing powerful visualization.

**&#8211; Take advantage of improved Performance, usability, visualization, and integration with the 2007 Microsoft Office Suites in SQL Server Reporting Services.**

Empowers users to answer complex questions by providing the relevent information through reports with powerful visualizations and rendered in Microsoft Office Word and Microsoft Office Excel. Enable users to create complex reports and share them internally and Externally with customers and partners.

**&#8211; Integrate location-enabled application through support for spatial data.**

Introduction of new Geography data type to store geodetic spatial data and perform opertaions on it. Also introduction of new Geometry data type to store planar spatial data and perform operations on it.

  <p class="cueListItem">
    Access data by defining business entities instead of tables and columns with the ADO.NET Entity Framework. Query and retrieve these entities natively within any .NET language with Language Integrated Query (LINQ). Enable developers to work with the logical entity model, and administrators to define the physical implementation of the model as tables and columns.

          Scale and manage large numbers of users and data with improved query performance on large tables. Optimize queries for data warehousing scenarios, and increase I/O performance with efficient and cost effective data storage. Integrate growing volumes of data from disparate systems with the scalable data integration features of Integration Services. Consolidate real-time data into the data warehouse with Change Data Capture functionality.
