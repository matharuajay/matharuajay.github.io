That more that you are grateful, the more you will receive in which to be grateful. When you feel gratitude in your life, you will notice that there is more for you to be grateful for.

Have you ever noticed that when you are in a REALLY good mood, nothing can bring you down. EVERYTHING seems to be going your way. And the day only gets better!
  
The same is true about celebrating, and about being grateful, and about being happy, and joyful, and excited, and peppy, and about, well, EVERYTHING! It is so easy to do!

Unfortunately, since it is easy to do, it is easy NOT to do. And therein lies the problem! Too many people don&#8217;t do it, or worse, they do the opposite! They focus on the bad, the bleak, the terrible, the unfortunate, the what-ifs that move towards tragedy, and all the negativity that holds one back from enjoying life.

You have a choice. What do you want to think about today?

What an awesome opportunity we have to choose.

Be Well.
