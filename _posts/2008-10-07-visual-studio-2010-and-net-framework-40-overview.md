<span style="font-size:x-small;"><span class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #0066cc;background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0;cursor:pointer;">Visual Studio</span> 2010 and the .NET Framework 4.0 mark the <span class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom:medium none;background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0;cursor:pointer;">next generation</span> of developer tools from <span class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom:medium none;background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0;cursor:pointer;">Microsoft</span>. Designed to address the latest needs of developers, <span class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom:medium none;background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0;cursor:pointer;">Visual Studio</span> and the .NET Framework deliver key innovations in the following pillars:</span>

  * <span style="font-size:x-small;"><strong>Democratizing Application Lifecycle Management</strong><br /> Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) crosses many roles within an organization and traditionally not every one of the roles has been an equal player in the process. <span class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom:medium none;background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0;cursor:pointer;">Visual Studio Team System</span> 2010 continues to build the platform for functional equality and shared commitment across an organization&#8217; s ALM process.</span>
  * <span style="font-size:x-small;"><strong>Enabling emerging trends</strong><br /> Every year the industry develops new technologies and new trends. With Visual Studio 2010, Microsoft delivers tooling and framework support for the latest innovations in application architecture, development and deployment.</span>
  * <span style="font-size:x-small;"><strong>Inspiring developer delight</strong><br /> Ever since the first release of Visual Studio, Microsoft has set the bar for developer productivity and flexibility. Visual Studio 2010 continues to deliver on the core developer experience by significantly improving upon it for roles involved with the <span class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom:medium none;background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0;cursor:pointer;">software development process</span>.</span>
  * <span style="font-size:x-small;"><strong>Riding the <span class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom:medium none;background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0;cursor:pointer;">next generation platform</span> wave</strong><br /> Microsoft continues to invest in the market leading operating system, productivity application and server platforms to deliver increased customer value in these offerings. With Visual Studio 2010 customers will have the tooling support needed to create amazing solutions around these technologies.</span>
  * <span style="font-size:x-small;"><strong>Breakthrough Departmental Applications</strong><br /> Customers continue to build applications that span from department to the enterprise. Visual Studio 2010 will ensure development is supported across this wide spectrum of applications.</span>

      Key to a shared understanding of the application is the use of modeling tools. Modeling has traditionally been done by professional architects and system designers. Our approach is to enable both technical and non-technical users to create and use models to collaborate and to define business and system functionality graphically.

From the design of the application through to the actual writing of the code, one of the most difficult problems has always been that of the bug that can’t be reproduced – the “no-repro” bug. There are a lot of factors that drive these types of bugs and we have worked to create tools to help isolate the issue and allow faster fixes. One of the common blockers to reproducing a bug is the collection of actionable data on the bug.  By dramatically simplifying the tools required to integrate testing across the lifecycle, we are further introducing new non-technical users to the application lifecycle.

      <strong>Better Together – Visual Studio Team System Development Edition and Database Edition</strong><br /> In recognition of the increased need to integrate more of the lifecycle members together, we will provide a unified Development and Database product in Visual Studio Team System 2010. Beginning October 1, 2008 Development Edition and Database Edition MSDN subscribers will have access to both products.

          <strong>Modeling that Works with Code</strong><br /> Powerful modeling tools are important for both defining new systems as well as discovering architectural information about existing systems. Our new modeling tools have tight integration into the actual code of the application enabling a developer or architect to use models to enforce constraints on code, as well as to explore existing code assets. <a id="ctl00_mainContentContainer_ctl02" href="http://ajaymatharu.wordpress.com/vsts2008/products/bb725993.aspx#Mod"><span style="color:#0033cc;">Learn more.</span></a>

          <strong>Identify the Test Impact</strong><br /> After making a change to the code it is critical to test the changes to prove they work as expected and to ensure no unexpected downstream effect. Test Impact Analysis helps developers quickly check-in code with confidence by running only the necessary tests. <a id="ctl00_mainContentContainer_ctl04" href="http://ajaymatharu.wordpress.com/vsts2008/products/bb725993.aspx#Id"><span style="color:#0033cc;">Learn more.</span></a>
