Last night I just saw this and thought of sharing it with everyone.

**&#8211; CLARIFY YOUR PURPOSE AND IDENTIFY YOUR STRENGTS**

Your ideal life cannot be found in your weaknesses &#8211; live in your strengts.

**-DEVELOP YOUR TOP STRENGTHS**

Become the best at what you do best &#8211; people will respect and pay for the best.

**&#8211; ACCEPT WHERE YOU ARE AS YOUR STARTING POINT**

If you let go of the PAST and embrace your PRESENT, your FUTURE is yours to choose.

**&#8211; SOLVE PROBLEMS AND RESOLVE PAST CONFLICTS**

To sail off to a new destination, you must pull up all the anchors in your life.

**&#8211; INVEST 10% OF YOUR TIME FOR YOUR FUTURE**

If you plan to stumble on your ideal life, stumble you will.

**&#8211; IDENTIFY AND BUILD UP YOUR MARGINS**

Ideal lifes are lived in the &#8216;margins&#8217; &#8211;Â with them you have The Law of Attraction.

**&#8211; REMOVE DRILLS AND REPAIR YOUR BUCKETS**

For your ideal life to hold water, you have to eliminate negative infulences.

**&#8211; SURROUND YOURSELF WITH POSITIVE INFLUENCES**

You must build your ideal environment, before you can build your ideal life.

**&#8211; REVIEW AND RE-COMMIT OFTEN**

Success is a journey, not a destination. Always be ready to adapt to new options.

**&#8211; ATTEND WORKSHOPS AND POLISH YOUR DIAMOND**

We all are diamonds in the rough, in need of regular cleaning and maintainance from professionals.
