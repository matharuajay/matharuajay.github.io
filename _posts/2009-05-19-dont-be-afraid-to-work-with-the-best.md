The best people can be difficult. They are single-minded, they have tunnel vision. That&#8217;s whtat makes them good. They are reluctant to compromise. They can be intimidating, especially to the young, but if you approach them with an attitude that you want to do something well, they will respond positively. Because they want to do something well too.

And if you are clear baou twhat you want and strong about getting it, though there may be arguments, they will respect you (if not at the time, afterwards).

The chances of you coming away with a superior job is not guaranteed, but it&#8217;s greater than if you had worked with Mr. Average Nice Guy.

So just move ahead with go get it attitude and you&#8217;ll get it <img src="https://www.ajaymatharu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
