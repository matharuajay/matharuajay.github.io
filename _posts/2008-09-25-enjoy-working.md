Are you ever fed up of your work? Want to get rid of it? Then this is not the right profession for you.

Have you ever asked yourself, why you chose to be in this profession? If you can find an answer to this question, then that&#8217;s great. You have found a reason to love your job and the work you do. And this is really very good. You are doing what you like and some one is paying you for that. Isn&#8217;t that awesome. What else do you want? The first thing you want in life is happiness and if you enjoy your work nothing great then that.

But if you are not able to find an answer to this question, you don&#8217;t have a strong reason on why you chose this profession, then you are caught in the wrong jump.

And if you could answer the question but still are unhappy, you have lost your aim. You are out of focus. Because when you chose this profession you had some aim, some goal to achive and since you are fed up that means you have lost the focus from your aim or goal.

The best thing to do is write down your answer on sheet of paper and stick it on your dashboard, this will help you keep focus. Read it everyday. Spend time to think on that and you ll start enjoying your work again. And now you will be in sync with your inner instinct and starting being happy. You ll start finding happiness in the work you do. Also always remember your answer or try to find your answer in any sort of work you do that will also keep you agile and focused on your goals and aims.

Enjoy Working!!!!!!!!
