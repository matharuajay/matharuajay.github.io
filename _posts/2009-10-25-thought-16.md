Can you be kind all day long today regardless of what happens to you? Try to see how long this can last. At the end of the day, review the act which you could no longer feel kindness. How do you feel about it in the evening? 

Be free to share it with everyone, drop a comment on how you felt <img src="https://www.ajaymatharu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
