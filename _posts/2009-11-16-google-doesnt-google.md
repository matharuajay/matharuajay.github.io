Does google really google? 

Ironically, google the search engine company, is gathering flack from the industry for not &#8216;googling&#8217;. According to reports, the company recently released its new programming language and named it &#8216;Go&#8217;. However, another language by that name already exists and even has a significant profile on Google&#8217;s own servers. The original &#8216;Go&#8217; language creator, Frank McCabe, is apparently up in arms over Google&#8217;s &#8216;Go&#8217;, and is demanding the company change the name of its language so he doesn&#8217;t have to change the name of his own programming language. According to McCabe, he has been working on the language since 10-odd years. &#8220;There have been papers published on this and I have a book too.&#8221; he is reported to have said.
