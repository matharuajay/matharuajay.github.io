<p class="MsoNormal">
  All of us want to be good at our jobs, but how good do we really want to be?
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Quite good.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Good.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Very Good.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  The best in our field.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Or the best in the world?
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Talent helps, but it won’t take you as far as ambition. Everybody wants to be good, but not many are prepared to make the sacrifices it takes to be great.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  To many people, being nice in order to be liked is more important. There’s equal merit in that, but you must not confuse being good with being liked.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Most people are looking for a solution, a way to become good. There is no instant solution, the only way to learn is through experience and mistakes.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  You will become whoever you want to be.
