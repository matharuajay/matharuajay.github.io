Now this: Mac malware is now circulating across the Net via pirated copies of Apple&#8217;s new iWorks software.

The &#8220;iServices.a&#8221; Trojan hitchhikes on iWork &#8217;09&#8217;s installer. The installer for the Trojan horse is launched as soon as a user begins the installation of iWork, following the installer&#8217;s request of an administrator password.

Once the Mac is infected, the Trojan phones home to let daddy know it arrived safely and is awaiting further instructions. Since then, the same bit of viral nastiness &#8212; dubbed OSX.Trojan.iServices.B &#8212; has begun showing up in pirated copies of Adobe Photoshop CS4, according to Macworld.

Glass-half-full types can view this as further proof of the Mac&#8217;s success; it&#8217;s now installed in sufficient numbers to be worth the attention of botnet herders. Also: That room full of manure is sure to have a pony inside.
