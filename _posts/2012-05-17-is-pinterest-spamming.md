{EAV:89877567cae0a34d}Lately, Pinterest have really grown enormously. It has very intuitive design and very good concept of visual bookmarking. Infographics shared on pinterest are just amazing, you get to know all the collated information at one page, in one single very attractive image.

Today, while pinning I came across a page, saying, scavenger hunt price. It was clearly a pinterest page but when you click on any of the listed gift, it takes you to another site. That, another site, was surely a SPAM as detected by anti-virus. Guys beware of such spams
