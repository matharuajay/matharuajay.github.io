In the social networking arms race, without a doubt Facebook and Myspace are the leading contenders. But now, at least on a global stage, it looks like a definitive leader between the two giants has emerged, with Facebook claiming double the visitors of Myspace.

Reported by <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/22/facebook-now-nearly-twice-the-size-of-myspace-worldwide/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>, according to a new data report from comScore Facebook drew more than 200 million unique visitors in the month of December compared to Myspace&#8217;s number, just over 100 million. Just six months ago Facebook and Myspace were tied around 100 million visitors, but Facebook&#8217;s numbers shot up at a rate of 10.8 percent per month on the global scale while Myspace stayed stagnant.

In the U.S., Myspace still leads, but has not grown its visitor numbers for most of the year. Facebook, on the other hand, has been increasing at a rate around 3.8 percent each month so while Myspace is currently the leader, it won&#8217;t be for long if the trend continues. By the end of this year, Facebook should have a lead over Myspace in the U.S., in addition to absolutely trouncing Myspace worldwide.
