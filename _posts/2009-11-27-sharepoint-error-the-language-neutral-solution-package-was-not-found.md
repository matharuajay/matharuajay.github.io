Last night while developing an event listener custom list, I ran into this error, 

> <div>
>   SharePoint Error: &#8220;The language-neutral solution package was not found&#8221;
> </div>

The solution to this problem is, Restart your visual studio. And it will be back to normal.

Hope this helps <img src="http://www.ajaymatharu.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
