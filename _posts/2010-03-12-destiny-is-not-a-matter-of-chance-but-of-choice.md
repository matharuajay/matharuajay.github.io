&#8220;Destiny is not a matter of chance, but of choice. Not something to wish for, but to attain.&#8221;

&#8211; William Jennings Bryan

Statistic show that not all of the students will complete the course, nor will all obtain their goal of a degree. The degree is not something they can wish for, but they must attain it by sacrificing their time and efforts to complete the work required in the course.

Do you have a goal that you are working towards? Is there something that you are giving up in order to obtain it? This might be sleep, it might be TV, it might be Fast Food. What are you going for and what is it that you must give up in order to get there?
