We all know about the need to take breaks stave off muscle fatigue, but let&#8217;s face it: Hours can pass while we stay in the same keyboard, pounding on our keyboards. <a href="https://www.smartfishtechnologies.com/" target="_blank">Smartfish Technologies</a> is bringing a new, smarter keyboard to market in March. The wired keyboard, expected to sell for $150, automatically adjusts itself over the course of a day.

For every hour of work, the keyboard makes some movement; it adjusts side to side within a space of about 1.5 inches. It also flexes and extends up and down to help promote blood flow. After about 20,000 keystrokes, the keyboard will move more frequently to help further mix things up. The keys vary in size, because of the curve in the keyboard, and to promote variation among your typing movements.
