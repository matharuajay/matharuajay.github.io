The U.S. is officially in a recession and the lean times are even hitting high-flying Google. The Wall St. Journal reports that Google has realized its &#8220;torrid growth&#8221; can&#8217;t go on forever and is implementing a series of belt-tightening moves aimed at helping it weather the current economic downturn. These include cutting back on engineers&#8217; less promising &#8220;pet&#8221; projects (so much for that vaunted 20% time), while focusing more on probable profit-generators such as display ads and mobile phone advertising. While the moves are disappointing &#8212; especially for the engineers that Google lured in with promises of a blank checkbook &#8212; they aren&#8217;t surprising in this economic climate. But Google&#8217;s success has always been predicated on its engineer-run culture. Keep aiding the customer&#8217;s Internet experience and the revenue will follow. As Google cut costs, it has to make sure it also doesn&#8217;t cut opportunities.

Google&#8217;s new mindset is captured in remarks from CEO Eric Schmidt:

Google&#8217;s initiatives can be taken two ways. Either the company is finally growing up and its newfound bean-counter mentality is just part of the process, or it&#8217;s actually given up on a core part of its company culture. Some key steps it is reportedly taking:

  * New hires go to revenue-generating groups first.
  * Ad-sales reps now have to meet quotas.
  * More employees now find their pay tied to performance.
  * Standard procurement, and price paid, across departments.
  * Hiring only when needed, not just when talent is available.
  * Earmarking funds for only the most promising projects.
  * Building data centers only when capacity needs require them.
