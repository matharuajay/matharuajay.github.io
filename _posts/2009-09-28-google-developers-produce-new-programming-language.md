A new programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine is available thanks to a couple of Google&#8217;s developers.  Called Noop (pronounce it like an abbreviated version of &#8220;no operation&#8221;), the developers claim that it combines the finest aspects of other languages and attempts to guide users towards accepted best practices.

Other parts of the new [Noop homepage](http://code.google.com/p/noop/) (which is hosted by Google Code) explain that Noop &#8220;in source form looks similar to Java.  The goal is to build dependency injection and testability into the language from the beginning, rather than rely on third-party libraries as all other languages do.&#8221;

Then, &#8220;Immutability and minimal variable scope are encouraged by making final/const behavior the default and providing easy access to a functional style.  Testability is encouraged by providing Dependency Injection at the language level and a compact constructor injection syntax.&#8221;

The Noop website is pretty well built out if you&#8217;d like more information.  Google&#8217;s developers provided all sorts of details about the current state of things and where Noop may go, as well as a place or two in which folks can give feedback.
