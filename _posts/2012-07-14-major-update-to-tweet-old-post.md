A long awaited update. Tweet old post has been updated to v4 now.

Checkout the latest updates

&#8211; You can have your own application name instead of  &#8220;Tweet Old Post&#8221;. That is whenever a tweet will be posted from the plugin it will show the application name you have configured in the settings. However it is bit difficult rather a lengthy process to create your own application name in twitter. Whatever application name you create it will appear under &#8220;via&#8221; in that tweet. For this you have to create an application in twitter and specify its &#8220;Consumer Key&#8221; and &#8220;Consumer Secret&#8221;. <a title="Creating Twitter Application for Tweet Old Post WordPress Plugin" href="https://www.ajaymatharu.com/creating-twitter-application-for-tweet-old-post-wordpress-plugin/" target="_blank">Creating Twitter Application for Tweet Old Post WordPress Plugin</a>.

&#8211; Pages can now be included. Added an option to select what is to be tweeted (pages, posts, or both).

&#8211; Removed &#8220;.&#8221; and used &#8220;-&#8221; when adding additional text, &#8220;.&#8221; was causing grammatical mistakes if sentence was trimmed.

&#8211; Added option to specify number of posts that can be tweeted simultaneously. You can specify a maximum of 10 and minimum of 1. If you specify 4 it will pick 4 random posts and tweet it. So basically you can specify how many tweets you want at a time.

&#8211; Last but not the least, removed random time slot was causing lot of confusion.

** Note: Please update your settings once after updating.**
