Superman&#8217;s most impressive feat was perhaps his balancing act. Besides being a hreo, he was also a newspaper reporter. Tennise ace Venus Williams is also both an entrepreneur and a dress designer. And ulike Superman, she is real! And an efficient multi-tasker!

During testing times like these, companies are forced to enhance their performance levels and seek equality from its employees and if you are an excellent multi-tasker, you definitely have an edge over the rest, point out experts.

Some tips to encourage multi-tasking at workplace:

&#8211; Identify additional responsibilities that employees can shoulder
  
&#8211; Ensure these are broadly aligned to their area of work; don&#8217;t give them something that they cannot find value in or identify with.
  
&#8211; Train them to take on more responsibilities and equip them to bridge gaps in knowledge and/or skill.
  
&#8211; Motivate them to stretch the boundries of their capabilities.
