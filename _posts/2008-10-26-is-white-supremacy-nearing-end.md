Come November and the era of the domination of the coloured race will begin. Lewis Hamilton on the verge of winning the Formula One championship, India&#8217;s successful moon mission, Obama win in elections, will ensure the end of domination of the whites.

It will mark a new beginning. And it is very significant as it is the Asians and the non-whites who are emerging as great powers.
