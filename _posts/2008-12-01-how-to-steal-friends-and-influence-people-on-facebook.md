If you&#8217;re on Facebook, you&#8217;ve no doubt got a bunch of friends. And if you&#8217;re like most Facebook users, you&#8217;re certain those friends are exactly who they say they are. And you might be right. Or you could be wrong. They could be scammers posing as your friends.

Step 1: Request to be &#8220;friends&#8221; with a dozen strangers on MySpace . Let&#8217;s say half of them accept. Collect a list of all their friends.Step 2: Go to Facebook and search for those six people. Let&#8217;s say you find four of them also on Facebook. Request to be their friends on Facebook. All accept because you&#8217;re already an established friend.

Step 3: Now compare the MySpace friends against the Facebook friends. Generate a list of people that are on MySpace but are not on Facebook. Grab the photos and profile data on those people from MySpace and use it to create false but convincing profiles on Facebook. Send &#8220;friend&#8221; requests to your victims on Facebook.

As a bonus, others who are friends of both your victims and your fake self will contact you to be friends and, of course, you&#8217;ll accept. In fact, Facebook itself will suggest you as a friend to those people.

Step 4: Now, you&#8217;re in business. You can ask things of these people that only friends dare ask.
