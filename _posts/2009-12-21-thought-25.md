&#8220;He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has.&#8221;

&#8212; Epictetus

If you are happy with that which you have, life will always be
  
good. This is not to say that you cannot strive for more. But
  
happiness lies in being content.
