    Microsoft on Tuesday will give developers a preview of a hosted version of Office after more than a year of speculation about when the company would put its productivity suite on the Web to compete with Google Docs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At the Professional Developers Conference on Tuesday, Microsoft will demonstrate a &#8220;lightweight&#8221; hosted version of Office, called Web Applications for Office, that includes Web-based versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.

    Microsoft&#8217;s Office desktop productivity suite is one of its biggest revenue generators and most popular software offerings, which may explain why the company has waited so long to introduce a hosted version of the suite. In the meantime, Google Docs, a Web-based office suite, is beginning to gain some traction among enterprise users as a real Office competitor, although it is nowhere close to being as widely used as Microsoft&#8217;s software. Microsoft initially will hold back features from the desktop version of Office in its hosted version.

  <p>
    Microsoft has adopted a &#8220;software plus services&#8221; approach as the industry moves toward using Web-based offerings either in place of traditional software or alongside it. Web Applications for Office is a part of this strategy, allowing Microsoft to respect the needs of existing Office desktop users while staying current with the industry&#8217;s overall move to hosted services.
