<p class="MsoNormal">
  When we attend a lecture, we generally go to see the speaker not to hear what they have to say. We know what they have to say. That’s why we go to see them.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  How many speeches have your heard? How many of them can you remember?
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Words, words, words and words. <span> </span>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  In a song, we remember firstly the melody and then we learn the words. Instead of giving people the benefit of your wit and wisdom, try painting them a picture.
</p>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The more strikingly visual your presentation is, the more people will remember it. And more importantly, they will remember you. </span>
