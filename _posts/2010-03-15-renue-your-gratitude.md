> &#8220;As each day comes to us refreshed and anew, so does my gratitude renew itself daily. The breaking of the sun over the horizon is my grateful heart dawning upon a blessed world.&#8221;

How awesome is it that you get to start over every day?! If the day before did not go as you would have liked it, you get another chance to start again! If at the end of the day you felt that you have not expressed your gratitude enough &#8211; no worries! Give it another shot tomorrow.

Many people dread Mondays. How does your Monday morning go? Do you work with people that are lethargic and disappointed that the weekend is over? I am always fired up on Monday! And I let people know it. Monday is a chance to start the new work week and give it your all. Which way do you you feel?
