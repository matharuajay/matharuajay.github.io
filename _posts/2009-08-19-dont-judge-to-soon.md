**When you know the truth!!!**

Train started running. Train was fully crowed as usual with young guys and gals, married couple, working uncle&#8217;s n aunties. All were irritated with the rush. Near the window one old man was sitting with his 30-year old son.

As the train Started moving, son was so fantasized with the scenery outside and said &#8220;Dad it so beautiful outside, all green trees and birds&#8230;!&#8221;

People sitting close to them stared laughing and were murmuring something

&#8220;What&#8217;s new in that?&#8221;

&#8220;Why this fellow is saying like this?&#8221;

Even some comment were passed &#8220;Pagal hai kya!!&#8221;, &#8220;This guys is gone crack!!&#8221;

Suddenly it started raining and climate was looking so pleasing and rain was even falling on the passengers, son was overwhelmed and asked &#8220;Dad, rain is so awesome, it&#8217;s making environment beautiful&#8230;!!&#8221; He was totally filled with joy.

Couple sitting next to them were so irritated because rain drops were dropping on their newly bought suitcase. Wife said &#8220;Is this man gone mad?&#8221;, &#8220;See old man your son is gone crack better put him in the mental asylum soon and please don&#8217;t disturb the normal public!!!&#8221;

Old man gave a sincere look to that lady and softly replied &#8220;My son has been discharged from the hospital this morning. He was born blind. Last week he got his vision. So he is seeing these all things for the first time and is enjoying it. Rain and nature is new to him. Please forgive us if we have disturbed you people.&#8221;

**The things we see may be right, from our perspective, until we know the truth. But when we know the truth, our reaction to that will hurt even us. So try to understand the problem better before taking a harsh action.**
