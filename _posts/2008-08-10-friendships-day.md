  We have something called as Fun Friday&#8217;s in our office we normally celebrate that every alternate friday. What we do in that is play games and enjoy. All it does is it keeps you fresh and agile its one of the most happening thing in my office. And the games are based on the theme or some festival which is goin on or which is awaited. The winning team is presented with choclates.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  This friday it was Friendship day which was comming up this sunday. So we decided so have something related to friendship some game related to friendship but our different ideas were all used in the previous fun friday&#8217;s so we had to think about some good idea for this Fun Friday to celebrate Friendship&#8217;s day.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  So we came up with the idea of Face Painting. We had created 5-6 teams of 7-8 members each of these 7-8 members 2 members were to be face painted and other need to paint their face and the theme was Friendship. So my team thought of painting the Tom and Jerry as they are very good friends because they cant live together and best part of their friendship is they cant even live without each other how much ever they fight but they cant live with and without each other. Here are the pics from this time fun friday,
