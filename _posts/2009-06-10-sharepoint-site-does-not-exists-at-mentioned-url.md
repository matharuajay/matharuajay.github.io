Hi Guys,

While working on the Sharepoint, I came across this error &#8220;Sharepoint site does not exists at mentioned URL&#8221;. On searching something I found that we&#8217;ll have to change the URL under the Project Properties.

<div style="width: 685px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <img title="Sharepoint site does not exists at mentioned URL" src="http://ajaymatharu.wordpress.com/files/2009/05/site.png" alt="Enter Sharepoint Site URL" width="675" height="429" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Enter Sharepoint Site URL
  </p>
</div>
