Google&#8217;s social-networking website Orkut has been used to spread a malicious Trojan, says Websense.According to an alert from the security firm, the hoax message, which has been received by a number of Orkut users and is written in Portuguese, looks like it comes from a lonely Orkut member looking for love and features a number of links which appear to link back to the social-networking site.

However, Websense urges Orkut users not to click the links as they result in the Trojan &#8216;imagem.exe&#8217; being downloaded. This subsequently opens the Orkut login page while a password-stealing Trojan called &#8216;msn.exe&#8217; is downloaded in the background.
