Losing a loved one is generally never easy. It does not matter if it is a spouse, a friend, a bother, a sister, a cousin, and especially if it was a child. Everyone grieves in their own way.

In order to live, there must be death. We should be grateful that we had the opportunity to have these people in our lives. Many times the anger or resentment that we experience due to the loss of a loved one is not for the person who has passed, but because we are saddened they are no longer with us. It is our own selfishness that traps us from moving ahead.

If you have experienced the loss of a loved one, recall the good times, think about the fun and love you shared. Honor the person.

Most of all, take the time that you need and heal at your own pace.
