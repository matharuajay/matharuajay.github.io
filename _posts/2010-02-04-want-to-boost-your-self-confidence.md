**Get a makeover:** 

Believe it or not, grooming yourself can make a huge difference to your selfimage . Get a new hair cut, buy some figure-flattering clothes or simply shower and shave, and feel the difference . Dressing well and looking presentable at all times is important.

**Be positive:** 

Having a negative self image can drag you down. Learn to replace your negative thoughts with positive ones. If you feel you are a pathetic dancer, take it upon yourself to learn a dance form. Take small steps to dispel your fears.

**Know yourself:** 

Get to know your abilities and your shortcomings. No matter how perfect someone appears, each of us has our flaws. The difference is that confident people concentrate on their abilities and showcase them. If youre a good singer, head for karaoke night. Keep a journal about your thoughts and focus on your talents.

**Be kind and generous:** 

This may sound silly, but helping others can do wonders for your self-image . When you do kind gestures, you will be rewarded by people , and that in turn, can make you feel more positive.

**Achieve your goals:** 

Set small goals for yourself and work towards accomplishing them. If you want to better yourself at your job, start reading more about it or speak to your seniors who have more experience. If you are shy and want to go out on a date, take small steps towards the direction by showing the person you like them. Dont get dissuaded easily.
