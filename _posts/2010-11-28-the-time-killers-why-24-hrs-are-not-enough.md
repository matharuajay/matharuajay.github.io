I have been trapped in this Time Killer stuff lately. thinking about doing something but not being able to do sucks. But do we really find out the reason on why were we not able to do what we are suppose to? or what we want to?



Here are some of my observations, and more likely my experiences

**The Social Network** &#8211; Being in the social world is amazing. News from one part of the world reaches another in no time. At the same time people are getting addicted to these sites. Competing with others on friends count, their post count or applications available on these sites these are time killers.

**Already Always Listening** &#8211; This is what you think you are. This is someone speaking to you continuously. Saying things like, &#8220;this is good&#8221;, &#8220;this is bad&#8221;, &#8220;look at the other person&#8221;, &#8220;ahh!! common its just 7 AM go to sleep again&#8221; and more such thing that pulls you back. But is this really who you are? 

**Habits** &#8211; As mentioned in above point, someone in you tell you I enjoy doing this. And this is when you start doing &#8220;This&#8221; so often. Doing something so often moves things from your conscious mind to your sub-conscious mind and that&#8217;s when things become habit. And these habits are really time consuming gaining you no result at all.

**Life is lifying** &#8211; Most of the times we are so lazy that we let things go as they are. We stay in our comfort zone. Staying in your comfort zone will not fetch you new results. How can you expect doing same things and getting different results?

**Stress** &#8211; After doing all the above things we think, &#8220;What was I suppose to do by this time?&#8221;, and since we haven&#8217;t done anything much on what we were suppose to do gives us more stress. This goes on and on this is nothing but a sign that you are caught in the rat race.



All this factors contribute to your time wasters and cause you more stress. You should set an action signal that will get you back to what you were doing. Action signal can be anything like, Punching you hand in air, or saying
  
&#8220;back to work&#8221;, &#8220;Common&#8221;, or anything like that. So next time you are doing something you are not suppose to do just do your action signal. 

Awareness is the first step. You can&#8217;t change what you don&#8217;t notice.
