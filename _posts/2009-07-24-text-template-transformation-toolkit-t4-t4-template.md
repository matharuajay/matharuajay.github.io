<span style="color:#bb6f02;">Text Template Transformation Toolkit</span> (T4) is a template-based code generation engine. This is one of the best things I found out today, so just thought of sharing with you guys.

This is awesome code generator template. This template is best used to generate your business logic code that will communicate with the database.

You can create a code page that will have all your database tables as Classes and their fields as its variables. So you will have your database tables as class and its columns as variables. You will have everything object oriented.

This template has an extension &#8220;.tt&#8221; and you can write code in any language C# or Vb and have the code file generated in any of these language you want. All you have to do is write the code in &#8220;.tt&#8221; file and its corresponding &#8220;.cs&#8221; or &#8220;.vb&#8221; file will be generated once you save your &#8220;.tt&#8221; file.

Its truly AMAZING!!!
