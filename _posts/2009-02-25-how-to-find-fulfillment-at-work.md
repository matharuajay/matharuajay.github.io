Work can be heavenly, hellish or somewhere in between. No matter what the circumstances of your work, you can make your professional life more fulfilling. Here&#8217;s how you can do it:

&#8211; Try to broaden your vision beyond the job you perform. Find out as much about your company as you can.

&#8211; Volunteering for new and more challenging assignments as soon as they become available will help. Ask before your boss thinks of someone else.

&#8211; Ask your boss what can be done to raise the level of responsibility and creativity in your present assignment. If you want a more enriched job, ask for it. Make suggestions.

&#8211; Expand your capabilities, learn new skills. Enjoy the feeling that you can do your job as well as anyone has ever done it.

&#8211; Make use of opportunities to help coworkers succeed. Take newcomers and less experienced employees under your wing. Teach them everything you know.

&#8211; Think up ideas for doing your job better, faster and differently. This will pump you up, as will the appreciation you receive from your superiors.

&#8211; If none of the ideas above do the trick for you, and you&#8217;re determined to feel better about your vocation, start hunting for a new situation that meets your needs to grow while you work.
