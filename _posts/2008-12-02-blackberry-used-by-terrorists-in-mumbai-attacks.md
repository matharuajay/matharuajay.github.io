The terrorists in Mumbai might have committed inhuman acts, but in at least one way, they are just like you and me. When authorities cut the cable feeds to the hotels where <span style="color:#dc870e;">the terrorists held over 200 hostages</span>, they relied on another piece technology to monitor the police response and the world&#8217;s reaction to the attacks: BlackBerrys. Commandos were not only surprised to find the devices in the terrorists&#8217; rucksacks, but that they used the internet to look beyond local Indian media for information, watching the global reaction in real-time as well.

It&#8217;s somewhat striking that the terrorists&#8217; use of BlackBerrys &#8220;caught the anti-terrorist forces by surprise.&#8221; While perhaps another step forward in the sophistication of their organization, in that it it makes communication more instant than ever, it&#8217;s long been reported that terrorist networks use the internet and cellphones for communication.
