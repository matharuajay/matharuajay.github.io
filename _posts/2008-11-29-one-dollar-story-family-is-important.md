There was a young boy,
  
One Day &#8211; In the evening,
  
the moment father returned from the office,
  
he asked a question to his father,
  
&#8220;Dad, How much do you earn an hour?&#8221; &#8211; said the boy
  
Father replied, &#8220;10 Dollars an hour&#8221;,
  
&#8220;Dad, can I have 1$ please?&#8221; &#8211; said the boy
  
Here you go!, Father gave 1$ to his boy,
  
Boy have a few notes in his pocket too, he then started counting,
  
It was alltogether USD 10$,
  
&#8220;What you want to do with this?&#8221; &#8211; said the father
  
Boy replied&#8230;&#8230;.
  
&#8220;Dad, with this $10, I want to buy an hour of yours.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Can you come an hour early tomorrow, to have dinner with me?&#8221;
  
said the boy with giving $10 to his father.
  
Familiy is Important
  
We should not let time slip through our hand
  
without having spent some time
  
with those who really matter to us,
  
those close to us.
