quote from Oprah Winfrey “I feel that luck is preparation meeting opportunity.”

Here are 5 tips for creating some great luck for yourself:

1. Learn to talk to anyone. Yep. Anyone. It sounds small, but that one simple habit can change your life. Whether on Twitter or in “real life,” once you master this skill, you will realize that at any moment you can go out into the world and meet new people, build friendships, learn new things, even grow your business.

2. Never burn bridges. It has taken me many years to be able to type that with confidence. I had to learn that sometimes it is more important to smile and nod than to be right. Pick your battles carefully because you never know when your path will cross with that person again.

3. Recognize divine appointments. Have you ever accidentally mis-dialed a phone number and noticed that the person you randomly called seemed fun to talk to? Have you ever met one person and because of that meeting, the course of your entire life changed? I call those divine appointments. I no longer believe that the people that come across our paths are random. Everyone is in our space for a reason.

4. Always be open to new opportunities, personally and professionally. Follow your intuition. If you aren’t growing or creating anymore in your current capacity, and if your intuition is leading you in another direction, don’t fight it. Sometimes I meet young people that say, “My degree is in accounting. I am only interested in applying for accounting positions.” Meanwhile, they’ve been unemployed for six months. By being so rigid, the most perfect career in the world might pass them by because they weren’t willing to even look into it.

5. Hang out with other lucky people. Mark Victor Hansen always says that we are the product of the five people we hang out with most. If that’s true, then hang out with lucky people. It will rub off on you! Run away from negative people like you are running away from a burning building.

Be brave, it will get your adrenaline pumping. You know the saying – If you’re not living on the edge, you’re taking up too much space!
