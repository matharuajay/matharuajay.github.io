[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-381" title="azure" src="http://ajaymatharu.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/azure.png" alt="" width="358" height="143" />](http://ajaymatharu.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/azure.png)Microsoft revealed a significant shift in its strategy Monday, introducing two new and drastically different Windows products at its annual Professional Developers Conference in Los Angeles. First, there is Microsoft&#8217;s cloud-based Windows system, Azure, which takes the focus away from the individual PC and has Microsoft customers relying more on Web services instead of desktop applications. Then, there is Vista&#8217;s successor, Windows 7, which serves as Microsoft&#8217;s next operating system (OS) &#8212; but without the bulk.

Azure is being billed by Microsoft as a cloud operating system, or an OS that exists within a network framework. Developers will create services and applications based on the framework. Consumers will then use those applications in a hybrid desktop-online manner, similar to how Windows Live Services such as Windows Live Photo Gallery function now. For example, you can access and manage your photo library via either a Web browser or a Windows Live Photo Gallery &#8211; blurring the line between Web service and desktop application.

Then there is Windows 7, slated for release in 2010. It presents users with a leaner OS, pushing consumers to rely more on Windows Live Services such as Windows Mail or Movie Maker. Gone will be the plethora of built-in software applications, with programs instead being downloaded a&#8217; la carte as desired.
