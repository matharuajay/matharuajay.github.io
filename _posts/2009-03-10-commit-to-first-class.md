One of the habits in the star performers and extraordinary leaders is their commitment to ensuring that their surroundings reflect their devotion to being world class. They drive the highest quality cars, live in the best homes and war the finest clothes. Their philosophy generally seems to be, &#8220;I stand for being the best so it only makes sense that I should invest in the best.&#8221;

Now here&#8217;s the big Idea: They held that belief even when they were not successful.

Greatness is, above all else, a state of mind. You need to believe in your potential and power before you can bring them to life. You need to feel like you are extraordinary.

To see spectacular results in your external life, you have to emotionally viscerally create a blueprint of your vision within your inner life.

One of the best ways to achieve this feeling is to ensure that everything you surround yourself with is at the highest level. In one of the books _Bring out the magic in your mind_, there is an idea that says, in order to be successful, it&#8217;s important to go where the successful people are. Even if you have only $10, go have a coffee at the best restaurant in your city.

Your surroundings shape the way you feel. And the way you feel drives what you do. Feel world class and you&#8217;ll behave world class. Invest in the best. Buy the highest quality goods you can possibly afford. Better to buy one superb pair ofÂ  shoes than three cheap ones. &#8220;Quality is remembered long after price is forgotten.&#8221;

If you&#8217;re really serious about standing for the best, then surround yourself with the best. Rewarding yourself with good things sends a message to the deepest and highest part of you. One that says &#8220;I&#8217;m worth it and I deserve it.&#8221; this will inspire you to reach even higher, work even harder and be even better.
