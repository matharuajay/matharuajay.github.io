Suppose one of your close friend or one of your relative comes to you. And he asks for your advice on one of the most critical matter. You take full interest in that matter and give them your adivce, suggest them. considering that problem to be yours.

After some day you come to know they did something else, which you suggested was not correct. Something that shouldn&#8217;t be done. You feel why the hell I keep giving advice and suggestions, to people if they don&#8217;t value it. You feel very low thinking about this, feeling bad that you are of no value to them, because you feel if you had any value to them they must have done what you suggested, or what you advised them, to do.

What will you do in this condition? How can you make sure this does not happens to you again?

One thing you can do is make sure they think about your advice or suggestion consiously. if you can not guarentee that make sure you are unaffected by their act. Another thing you can do is, take something from the person to whome you are giving the advice for e.g. take a dairymilk choclate for giving a advice. In this way you will feel that you advice was not useless, coz you got something for that. And even the person taking the advice will think if he is giving something for the advice then it must be tried. Although you&#8217;ll still feel bad if they still don&#8217;t consider your advice, but anyways you got something for your advice.

So keep taking something for the advice you give. Else you will be one of the VICTIM of this mouse trap.
