If you thought that the only way to feel elated is by drinking alcohol or drugs, think again. There are several ways by which you can get a natural high, which basically happens when there is a release of endorphins or &#8216;feel good&#8217; chemicals that give you a sense of well-being.

Run
  
Put on your running shoes, and just take off! The term &#8216;runner&#8217;s high&#8217; couldn&#8217;t be more apt. Don&#8217;t expect anything, if you plan on running just for a few minutes &#8211; yo need to for at least 30 minutes before you start feeling good. You may feel incredibly tired during the first 15 minutes, but hang on in there, and soon enough you will feel the difference. This natural high occurs because of the endorphins that are released during such an intense form of exercise.

Laugh
  
Whoever said that laughter is the best medicine, couldn&#8217;t be more accurate. Notice how you feel when you&#8217;ve had a really good laugh till your jaw hurts or when you have tears rolling down your eyes. This feeling of goodness will give you a high like anything else. Discuss a funny incident with friends, or watch a really movie or a television series. the more you laugh, the more endorphins will be released in your system.

Listen to music
  
Listen to some instrumental music. Not only will this calm you down and help you relieve stress, but also bring about a sense of happiness. Even listening to your favorite songs can have a similar effect. Make a separate file of songs that make you smile, and call it your &#8216;happy song&#8217; folder. Listening to it when you are down will cheer you up.

Meditate
  
the benefits of meditation are numerous. A few minutes of meditation takes you to a calm, relaxed state, which in turn gives you a natural high. You could meditate at home or even join a class. There are different techniques for meditation. The internet has loads of information that will be of great help. Meditate to lower your heart rate and keep your blood pressure in check.
