When you do something nice for someone, when you do them a favor, or when you give them a gift, you will get something back. This is true even if you are not expecting to receive anything back from them. The Universe/God/Spirit/Consciousness/You (whatever you want to call it) feels your gratitude in you and will return it to you.

It is like the old saying, &#8220;**What goes around, Comes around.**&#8221; You may give someone a rose, but the fragrance of your gift literally remains on you.

When you think good thoughts, good things will happen to you. When you express your gratitude, more will be provided to you for which you can be grateful.

It is a wonderful cycle.

Be Well.
