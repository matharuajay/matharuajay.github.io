> To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
  
> &#8211; Ralph Waldo Emerson 

There is so much pressure on people to conform. Pressure to be something you are not. Pressure to fit in. So much for originality!

What is up with that?! Be yourself. Be grateful that you are different. Express your uniqueness. Celebrate diversity!
