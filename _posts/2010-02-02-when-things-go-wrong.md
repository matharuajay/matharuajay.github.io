Are you working on a project or something that seems like it is impossible? Feel like giving up? If so, just hang in there! Remember that the difference between ordinary and extraordinary is just a little &#8216;extra&#8217;. Keep at it! You will see results soon. You will certainly feel grateful for hanging in there.
