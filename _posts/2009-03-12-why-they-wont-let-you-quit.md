 sale season, that new Blackberry or even a holiday in France, you want it all!!! So  you&#8217;re planning to wait around until the end of the financial year for tha much deserved raise. Well darlin&#8217;, given the current recession, the chances of a fat paycheck are super low. Dissapointed? Think quitting is teh answer? You may put in your papers, but be ready for the tempting offer from HR.

**Indispensability quotient**
  
Assessing &#8216;key critical areas&#8217; is the first step that your superiors and HR manager would take. They identify if an employee&#8217;s cost of replacement is high, and how much tim eand effort was invested in training that individual. They also identify how he/she is important in achieving an organisation&#8217;s goals.

**Time Please!
  
** If you are absolutely keen on leaving your existing workplace in teh hope that your future job will assure you a hfty salary, then you will be given adequate time to re-think your decision. They try to explain to the employee that the future cost-to-company (C2C) will not be as much as his existing C2C thanks to the recession. They will also give you time to stand the real-world situation. But if you have the capability recession can&#8217;t pull you back.

**Free Advice**
  
Expect this for sure. Everyone, from your boss to your colleagues and the HR manager will spout words of wisdom. While some of your colleagues will encourage you to leave, just so youare out of their way, yout true friends will say, &#8216;how much they will miss you&#8217;. Your boss will find you an &#8216;asset&#8217;.
  
They will explain to you, how in the next few years you could be hading an entire team and why you have bright prospects in the organisation.

**Take a hike**
  
This is the most obvious solution. If you are unhappy with your current salary and designation and are contemplating to quit, then you are sure to get a shot in the arm. The catch is you need to be in your boss&#8217; good books and equally good at your work, for that much desired hike.
  
If you are deserving and an asset to the organisation, then the designation can be changes. Not only that, in most cases you&#8217;ll get more responsibility as an additional benifit.

But remember **&#8220;Do not take responsibility without power&#8221;.**

Perk it up
  
If you are thinking of quiting simply because you are not enjjoying your job, then an employee referral programme might be suggested. This includes an opportunity where you can rope in your friends or acquaintances in the same sompany and get a salary raise.

So, this time around when you threaten to quit, give in to temptation instead!!!
