Yesterday I just gave a small presentation on team building. It was more of an hour workshop then a session. I am just posting the presentation now, however I&#8217;ll post the task/exercises I took for the teams in my session, so keep checking out.

Please read the tortoise story in this presentation, its really nice one.
