**Web Development**

****
  
With ASP.NET, Microsoft delivered a ground breaking
  
productive development model that made web applications
  
accessible to the traditional application developer. Over the last
  
few releases, not only has the tooling in Visual Studio improved
  
to provide developers with a more web standard set of tools,
  
but leading features like CSS property grids and split view
  
design surfaces have been provided.
  
However the industry evolves, and so do the tool requirements
  
and patterns that developers use. Web developers are leading
  
the push to split content from data and to use a Test Driven
  
Development (TDD) methodology. In Visual Studio 2010,
  
the next generation of ASP.NET web tools that make it
  
easy for developers to use TDD to build Model-View-Controller
  
(MVC) based web sites.
  
Many ASP.NET Developers have already experienced the
  
preview release of ASP.NET MVC. All the features in that release
  
are included in Visual Studio 2010. Ranging from Project
  
Templates and Solutions that natively describe an ASP.NET MVC
  
website, to automatic generation of test projects in the web
  
solutions, to wizard support for common tasks like creating
  
views from controllers and snippet support for HTML Markup,
  
the Visual Studio IDE delivers all the support required.
  
In Visual Studio 2008, was heavy in supporting
  
JavaScript in the Visual Studio IDE and debugger. In Visual
  
Studio 2010, there is higher
  
performance, and standards &#8211; compliant JavaScript IntelliSense
  
engine. These investments enabled Microsoft to announce their
  
involvement with the JQuery group, and Visual Studio 2010 will
  
be the first version of Visual Studio to ship JQuery as a native
  
part of the ASP.NET solution set.
  
Deployment of websites has been a challenge for developers for
  
many years. Visual Studio 2010 has full IDE support for a simplified
  
deployment process for ASP.NET websites. Called &#8220;One Click
  
Deployment&#8221;, this process and IDE support provides a wizard,
  
dialogs and design surfaces that make it simple for developers to
  
identify the components of a website that need to be deployed,
  
and handle the process of moving them from the development
  
machine to the web server, whether that is an internal server for
  
the organization or a server hosted by a 3rd party site.
  
&#8220;One Click Deployment&#8221; also solves the problem of changing
  
the settings of a website from the development machines to the
  
final deployed site. Many times developers have sent websites
  
to deployment with debug tracing turned on or the database
  
connections set to the development servers. With web.config
  
transformations, &#8220;One Click Deployment&#8221; enables a developer
  
to create a custom set of transforms that will be applied to
  
the website every time it is deployed and ensures that the
  
appropriate settings are in the configuration files.
  
Additionally, Microsoft has just released the Silverlight 2
  
runtime and tooling for Visual Studio 2008. In Visual Studio
  
2010, Silverlight is fully supported for developers wishing to
  
build Silverlight content. Having design surfaces for Silverlight
  
enables developers to either author original content or to
  
modify content as part of the designer-developer workflow
  
that Visual Studio enabled in the last release. Visual Studio
  
2010 also provides full debugging support for Silverlight and
  
provides project system integration for developers consuming
  
this content in various applications types. For example, web
  
developers building ASP.NET websites will be able to include
  
existing Silverlight content, and Visual Studio will create the
  
appropriate test pages and content includes to enable them to
  
focus debugging on the Silverlight content in the context of the
  
overall website solution.
