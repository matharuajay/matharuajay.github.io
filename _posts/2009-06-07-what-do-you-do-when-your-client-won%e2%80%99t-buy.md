<p class="MsoNormal">
  A client often has a fair idea of what he wants. If you show him what you want and not what he wants he’ll say that’s not what he asked for. If, however you show him what he wants first, he is then relaxed and is prepared to look at what you want to sell him.
</p>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">You’ve allowed him to become magnanimous instead of putting him in a corner. Give him what he wants and he may well give you what you want. There is also possibility that he may be right.</span>
