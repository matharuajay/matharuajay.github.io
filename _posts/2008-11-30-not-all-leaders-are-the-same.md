For a company to get to the greatness, every person on the team needs to see himself or herself as a leader. The best companies on the planet grow leaders and develop leadership potential throughtout the organization faster than their competition.

Making that happen is their number-one focus. And they do it quickly. Everyone is a leader, but not everyone is the same.

Everyone is the leader but not everyone deos the same thing. Everyone needs to behave lika a leader no matter what they do. Everyone needs to demonstrate leadership triats regardless of their position. That means everyone needs to take responsibility for getting the results that they generate. Everyone needs to do their part to shape culture. Everyone needs to be positive and inspirational. Everyone is a leader, but not everyone is the same.
