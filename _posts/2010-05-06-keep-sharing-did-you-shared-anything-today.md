ARE you one of those whose heart is full of compassion but the pockets dont quite match up Dont worry.In a country where millions struggle for basic necessities,money isnt the only way to reach out.Keep aside your cheque book and explore more meaningful ways to make a difference in this world.Yes,this story is not about the huge sums of money that mighty corporates or the rich donate.We are also not talking about how we gift clothes that weve outgrown or offerings made out of religious compulsions on auspicious days.

Give because you wish to give,not because you think you have to. Give something that you enjoy yourself.
