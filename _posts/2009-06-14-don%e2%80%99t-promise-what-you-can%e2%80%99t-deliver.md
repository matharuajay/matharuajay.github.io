  When selling our ideas, we tend to overpromise in our enthusiasm for our creation. In our vision of how we hope it will be, we leave no room for failure. The result will probably be disappointing. Not disastrous, but a little less than expected.

    No one will say anything, they just won’t trust you quite as much next time. Basically you’ve blown it. If instead you undersell, pointing out the possible weaknesses and how to resolve them, should they occur, you are not only building a trusting relationship with your client but you’re able to solve any problems. And if it does turn out the way you hoped, it is a bonus.
