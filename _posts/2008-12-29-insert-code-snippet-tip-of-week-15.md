Hi guys, do you know you can use already ready code inside your visual studio? Yes certainly you can insert code snippets into your code. You can invoke the &#8220;Insert Snippet&#8221; by using shortcut &#8220;ctrl k + ctrl x&#8221;.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694" title="snippet" src="https://ajaymatharu.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/snippet.jpg" alt="snippet" width="500" height="221" />

You can download some of the code snippets from https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718338.aspx all you need to do is install this file at &#8220;My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets&#8221; location. You can also find some more snippets at https://www.codeplex.com/snippetlibcsharp/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=14841 all you need to do is copy this snippet at &#8220;My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets&#8221; and you are ready to use these ready made code into your visual studio using shortcuts &#8220;ctrl k + ctrl x&#8221;

You can also insert the snippets by writing a part of it and pressing tab twice. For e.g. to insert a new property in your code type

prop + tab + tab

this will insert a property in your code window.

So keep using this to improve your productivity, and enjoy coding.
