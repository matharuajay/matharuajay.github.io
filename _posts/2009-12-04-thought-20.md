&#8220;Reflect upon your present blessings, of which every man has plenty; not on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some.&#8221;

&#8211; Charles Dickens

Your life is full of blessings and wonderful things! Look at them, inspect them, feel grateful for them. There are an unlimited list of things for which you can be grateful. Enjoy them!
