When something gets you down, do you wallow in the misery? Do you let yourself feel like crud? Or do you use it as an opportunity to look for the bright side of it and grow? Both are possible outcomes and both have a place. The important thing is to learn from the incident and move ahead.

When tragedy strikes I am not suggesting you &#8216;poo-poo&#8217; it off. On the contrary, you should stay in the moment and grieve, feel your emotions, process your feelings. These are all necessary. But to stop there is a problem. Take some time to examine how you can learn from this and how you may prevent it from occurring in the future.

When you turn bad into good, you will feel awesome!
