Have you ever wondered about people who seem to naturally attract
  
good stuff? They have no shortage of money, a circle of great
  
friends, loving and healthy relationships, great jobs, limitless
  
possibilities &#8211; everything seems to come so easily to them, while you
  
struggle and scrape by.

These people know the secret to living prosperously &#8211; and you can
  
learn it too! It&#8217;s simply a matter of changing the way you think,
  
feel and act &#8211; which will change the results you get in life.

Here are three major components of living a prosperous life:

1) Follow your passions.

Those prosperous people in your life do not settle for mediocrity,
  
have you ever noticed that? They likely have interesting jobs and
  
they aren&#8217;t afraid to try new things. Each day is a new adventure for
  
them, and they make a habit of squeezing every drop of joy out of
  
life that they can.

You can easily do the same by first giving some thought to the
  
things you feel passionate about. What did you used to love to do
  
when you were a child? What hobbies or creative pursuits do you enjoy
  
now? If you can&#8217;t come up with any ideas right away, explore! Try new
  
activities. Sign up for some classes and try new things. Let your
  
heart lead you in whatever you do, and before you know it you&#8217;ll be
  
living passionately too.

2) Believe in the possibilities.

Prosperous people know that as good as things are right now, they
  
can always get better. They believe in the limitless possibilities
  
that exist for their lives, and they quickly take advantage of
  
opportunities that come their way.

You can begin to adopt this same heightened awareness by expanding
  
your concept of what is possible for your life. Keep affirming that
  
your life is not static. Everything within and around you is in a
  
constant state of flux &#8211; nothing stays the same, ever. Learn to
  
embrace change, consult your inner guidance and take action on
  
improving your life, and you will automatically call in greater
  
opportunities.

3) Believe you deserve it.

Prosperous people have no doubt whatsoever that they deserve the
  
goodness in their lives. They are open to receiving all the blessings
  
and abundance they believe they deserve, and they gracefully (and
  
gratefully) accept.

You may not feel that you have worth issues, but ask yourself how
  
you react when someone gives you a compliment or an unexpected gift.
  
Do you express your thanks and gratitude, or do you try to refuse it
  
or dismiss it? If you are in the habit of turning away goodness in
  
all its forms, you might have an underlying belief that you don&#8217;t
  
deserve it. Start building a stronger belief in yourself and affirm
  
that you deserve much more than you have now. Express gratitude for
  
the blessings in your life, and when good things come your way &#8211;
  
embrace them!

If you keep up with these activities on a daily basis, you will
  
transform yourself into one of those people that seem to have a
  
prosperity magnet embedded in their brains.
