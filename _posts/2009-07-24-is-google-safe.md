    Search engines such as Google are increasingly being used by hackers against Web applications that hold sensitive data, according to a security expert.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Even with rising awareness about data security, it takes all of a few seconds to pluck Social Security numbers from Web sites using targeted search terms.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The fact that Social Security numbers are even on the Web is a human error; the information should never be published in the first place. But hackers are using Google in more sophisticated ways to automate attacks against Web sites.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Study recently discovered a way to execute a SQL injection attack that comes from an IP (Internet Protocol) address that belongs to Google.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a<strong> SQL injection attack</strong>, a malicious instruction is entered on a Web-based form and answered by a Web application. It often can yield sensitive information from a backend database or be used to plant malicious code on the Web page.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tools such as <strong>Goolag and Gooscan</strong> can execute broad searches across the Web for specific vulnerabilities and return lists of Web sites that have those problems.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another attack method is so-called <strong>Google worms</strong>, which use the search engine to find specific vulnerabilities. With the inclusion of additional code, the vulnerability can be exploited.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Google and other search engines are taking steps to stop the abuse. For example, Google has stopped certain kinds of searches that could yield a trove of Social Security numbers in a single swoop. It also puts limits on the number of search requests sent per minute, which can slow down mass searches for vulnerable Web sites.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In reality, it just forces hackers to be a bit more patient. Putting limits on search also hurts security professionals who want to do automated daily searches of their Web sites for problems.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There is another kind of attack called <strong>&#8220;site masking,&#8221;</strong> which causes a legitimate Web site to simply disappear from search results.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Google&#8217;s search engine penalizes sites that have duplicate content and will drop one from its index. Hackers can take advantage of this by creating a Web site that has a link to a competitor&#8217;s Web page but is filtered through a proxy server.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Google indexes the content under the proxy&#8217;s domain. If this is done enough times with more proxy servers, Google will consider the targeted Web page a duplicate and drop it from its index.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    One way Web site administrators can defend against this is barring their Web site from being indexed by anything other than the legitimate IP address of a search engine.
