Microsoft has delayed the public release of its Windows 7 beta download due to an overwhelming demand that its servers couldn&#8217;t handle.

&#8220;Due to very heavy traffic we&#8217;re seeing as a result of interest in the Windows 7 Beta, we are adding some additional infrastructure support to the Microsoft.com properties before we post the public beta,&#8221;.
