Buffer My Posts is my new plugin. Buffer My Post will help you schedule your wordpress blog posts to Buffer. Buffer is an amazing platform which helps you to schedule the post to various social sites like Twitter, Facebook, Facebook Page, and Google Pages.

Here&#8217;s how Buffer works,

> There are a few simple steps to getting set up. First, connect your profiles on the left. Then, for each profile, hop into the &#8220;Schedule&#8221; tab to choose the days and times that your posts will go out. To add a post, click the &#8220;what do you want to share&#8221; box at the top of the page, and type or paste in your post. Then, click the avatars for your profiles to choose which profiles this post will go to. Once you add it to your Buffer, you will see it under the &#8220;Buffer&#8221; tab for each of those profiles.

This is very much similar to my other plugin, <a title="Tweet Old Post" href="http://www.ajaymatharu.com/tweet-old-post/" target="_blank">Tweet Old Posts</a>, which posts it only to Twitter. Download _**<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a title="Buffer My Post" href="http://www.ajaymatharu.com/Buffer-My-Post.zip" target="_blank">Buffer My Posts</a></span>**_ and start scheduling your posts to Buffer.
