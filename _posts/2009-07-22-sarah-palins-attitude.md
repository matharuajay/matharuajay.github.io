It&#8217;s tough job, but someone&#8217;s got to stick up for Sarah Palin, the hottest candidate in the US election, Why is it suchÂ a surprise to some people that the Republican party has spent 90,000 euro on outfits and haridos for her campaign?

Are people seriously telling me that a vice-presidental candidate in the world&#8217;s richest democracy could fight a campaign wearing the wardrobe of a hockey mom?

No, spending a huge amount of somebody else&#8217;s money is something we expect of an ambitious policiticn and history suggests it&#8217;s rarely a vote-loser.

On the other hand, some of the things Palin says might be. Particularly interesting are the &#8216;facts&#8217; that relate to environment which contradict documented facts. If Sarah Palin is elected vice-president next month, president in 2012 be very afraid.
