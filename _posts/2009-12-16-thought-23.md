&#8220;Although there may be tragedy in your life, there&#8217;s always a possibility to triumph. It doesn&#8217;t matter who you are, where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. Always.&#8221;

&#8211; Oprah

Your attitude and how you feel is more important on determining your triumphs than many other factors. Is there someone thing you want to accomplish (or triumph over)? What 1 thing can you do right now to get you moving in that direction? It does not matter how small it is, just do it now! Enjoy the process!
