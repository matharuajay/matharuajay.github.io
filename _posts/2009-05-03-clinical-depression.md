Last night you came home tired and in &#8220;a bad mood&#8221; because of your boss&#8217; &#8220;unreasonable demands&#8221;. Then, you gave your family member a verbal bashing over something. You skipped dinner, set off to work in the morning feeling guilty and hopeless. It is a folly to blame your behaviour on a foul mood or a though time, just because you are prone to moddiness. If you&#8217;ve had a spate of such episodes of late, you might be in the middle of clinical depression.

**Just feeling low**

Power-cuts or salary cuts, there are many occasions for us to feel down in the dumps. It&#8217;s part of day-to-day life. But usually, these feelings don&#8217;t last for too long. Below are some of the symptoms of ordinary mood swings:

&#8211;Â  Avoiding communication and being quieter than usual.

&#8211; Avoiding participation in leisure activities or hobbies.

&#8211; Being alone and attempting to listen to music or reading.

&#8211; Being irritable to all those curious about your behaviour.

Note that all these symptoms do not last for long. Watching a flurry of sixes by Yuvraj Singh or just bumping into an old friend is all it takes for your spirits to rise to normal.

**Danger Signs**

So, when do you know you are a victim of clinical depression? Check if you show any of these symptoms:

&#8211; Difficulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions.

&#8211; Decreased energy, fatigue

&#8211; Loss of intrest in activities that wer once enjoyed

&#8211; Feelings of guilt, hopelesness and pessimism

&#8211; Insomnia, early monring awakening or oversleeping

&#8211; Loss of appetite and weight; overeating and weight gain

&#8211; Suicidal thoughts

&#8211; Physical symptoms that don&#8217;t respond to treatements, such as headaches.

In such conditions all you have to do is help yourself:

&#8211; Wake up early in the monring and practise meditation and yoga.

&#8211; Pen down your felings in a diary.

&#8211; Avoid clutter in your house, it adds to depression

&#8211; Avoid monotony, take regular breaks.

&#8211; Jog or walk regularly

&#8211; Long baths and fresh cloths add to your confidence

If you recognise yourself as a victim of depression, destressing alone would not help you. You must let go of the stigma and seek help. Depression can be successfully treated with medication, or professional counselling.
