Turns out, in Word 2007 all you have to do is use =lorem() instead of =rand() and you&#8217;ll be able to insert the lorem text instead.

Just type in =lorem() into your document, and hit the enter keyâ€¦

And just like that, Lorem Ipsum is inserted automatically!

Just like the other tip, you can use the following syntax:

=lorem(paragraphs,sentences)

For instance, for 6 paragraphs of 20 sentences each, you would use:

=lorem(6,20)
