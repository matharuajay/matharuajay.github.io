Most of us try to avoid asking for a promotion/raise. But it is worth mustering the courage, as the rewards are well worth it. But before you present your case, here are a few questions you ought to ask yourself:

&#8211; Does your performance speak for itself?
  
If the answer is yes, you have a change. Present all your achievements in the time you have been here. Showcase how these achievements are noteworthy and need recognition in the form of a promotion and raise. The best time to ask for one is immediately after a recent major achievement where you have displayed exemplary behavior.

But a word of caution here, it is not just the recent performance that would be considered, your past performance, ability to perform under pressure and meet tight deadlines would enhance your chances for a promotion.

&#8211; Are you ready to take on the additional responsibilities?
  
Promotion means additional responsibilities not only towards your job, but also towards organization building too. The expectation levels will also increase the moment you move to the next level. What was exceptional performance in the last role would be considered average in the new role. As you move ahead in your career, remember that there is no scope for complacency.

&#8211; Is there a position that you can fill in?
  
Companies do not offer promotions merely to satisfy employees. There must be a vacancy available. Organizations do not create positions to fill in your desires. Some organizations that do, might only satisfy your ego, give you a dignified position, and within a couple of months you realize that you are still stuck doing the same old routine tasks.

However, if ego issues are not involved and you have been creating value, been efficient and well informed, there is a possibility of you being given an opportunity to do something different, where you create something from scratch, perhaps a new department etc. This is your true test of performance, potential and perseverance.

&#8211; How to raise the topic?
  
Be very sure of what you want, why you want it and what makes you fit for the role. Do not show dissatisfaction at your current state of affairs. Present a positive picture by mentioning that you wish to contribute more towards the organization&#8217;s growth. Presentation with valid, relevant data would make your boss realize your potential. Perceived potential for growth matters a lot. Keep statistics handy during the discussion; showcase your contribution and achievement.
