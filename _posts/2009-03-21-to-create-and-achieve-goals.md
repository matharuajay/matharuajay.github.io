Everything we accomplish in life takes steps. To help us achieve our desires we need to set goals. Here is list of 10 steps that will help you create and achieve your goals.

**_&#8211; Pick One Goal :_**

This is important! You can only achieve your goals if you focus on them one at a time. Once your goal has been accomplished or made inot a stable habit you can start on the next goal.

**_&#8211;  Start Small and Easy :_**

The best way to suceed with your first goal is to pick something you are already doing, once in a while, but want to do daily. This will help prepare you to work on future goals. This will build your self confidence as you achieve the goal and help prepare you to work on future goals.

**_&#8211; Simplify :_**

Choose a small, specific goal or break up larger goals into small pieces that can be done on a daily basis. Big successes start with little ones.

**_&#8211; Write It Down :_**

Write your goal in large letters and place it where you will see it several times a day. Putting your goal to paper makes it official: You Want It!

**_&#8211; Keep Track Everyday :_**

This step is very important! If you don&#8217;t keep track of your daily progress you won&#8217;t progress. Everything we accomplish takes daily steps which turn the goal into a habit.

**_&#8211; You Have To Want It :_**

Pick goals you want to achieve or change your attitude so you really do want it.

**_&#8211; Schedule Time :_**

Here are three ideas to help you make time for your goal:

Prioritise: Make time by not doing things that are of less, or no, value.

Say No: Learn to gracefully to say no tho those who asky for your time when you already have too much to do.

Make the Time: You have to MAKE the time or you won&#8217;t MAKE the goal.

**_&#8211; Be Firm Yet Flexible :_**

To achieve your goal you have to be firm with yourself. You have to do the required work to accomplish your goal. You also have to be a bit flexible. Make a backup plan for days when achieving your goal might be difficult. Also, if your goal is something that you want to do six days a week but not on sunday you can pick a similar activity to replace your goal.

**_&#8211;  Be Positive :_**

Doubting thoughts, and words, will crush your goal. Think and say positive things. A suggestion is to &#8220;Talk to Yourself&#8221; by picking a positive, &#8220;phrase that you will train your mind to focus on at different times through out the day until it begins to dominate your awareness and reshape the person you are.&#8221;

**_&#8211; Pray About It :_**

Choosing righteous goals is just what the Lord wants us to do, so ask for his help. As you daily pray and work to wards your goal you will see daily success.

You will achieve your goals if you honestly follow these steps and daily keep track of your goals. Nothing tastes sweeter than success.
