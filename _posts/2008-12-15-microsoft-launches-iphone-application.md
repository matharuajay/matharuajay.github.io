Microsoft has launched an app for Apple&#8217;s iPhone. Microsoft and Apple are traditional rivals in the operating systems market, but that has not prevented the world&#8217;s largest software company from launching an application for the iPhone.

Seadragon Mobile is free to download from Apple&#8217;s iTunes App Store and gives users the ability to access online photo libraries either using the phone&#8217;s 3G or Wi-Fi connection.

These include images available of Microsoft&#8217;s Photosynth site, which allows users to stitch together hundred of digital photographs to create a 3D image that can then be looked at from all angles, or even viewed in close-up detail.

The apps also offers an RSS feed so users can be notified when new content is made available.
