## **Javascript Undefined vs NULL**

<div>
  Many a times we often get confused on whats the difference between UNDEFINED and NULL.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. On the other hand, null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.
</div>

<div>
  Also, undefined and null are two distinct types: undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object.

<div>
  Unassigned variables are initialized by JavaScript with a default value of undefined. JavaScript never sets a value to null. That must be done programmatically.
