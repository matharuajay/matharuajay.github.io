When was the last time you took a good hard look at your resume? Even if your job description hasn’t changed much recently, you don’t want to become complacent. You need to make sure your resume refl ects your latest accomplishments so that you can be next in line for a raise or poised to pounce on the opportunity that’s just around the corner. A resume revamp doesn’t have to be intimidating, either. In fact, in seven simple steps, your resume can refl ect the more accomplished IT manager you’ve become.

1. Look at the big picture. This pertains to printed resumes rather than text-based ones sent via the Web. What does your resume actually look like? Ignore the words for a moment. Is the layout clear and concise? Is the font easily readable? Remember that a sans serif font is harder to read that a serif font—though a sans serif font can look more modern. Choose your font size wisely; don’t go smaller than 11 pt type if you want anyone to read about all your accomplishments. Use bullet points, bold type, and spacing to help break up the information on the page.

2. Use strong action verbs to describe your job duties and accomplishments. You don’t want to present a laundry list of your day-to-day duties. Focus instead on the parts of your job that earn you recognition. Stress your leadership skills. For example, instead of writing that you are “involved in running a team of programmers and keeping projects on schedule,” try saying that you “manage a team that consistently meets deadlines.”

3. Be careful with your jargon. Is the important information readily accessible? If you’re job-hunting, remember that the people who initially screen resumes often have only basic technical knowledge; they might not know an MCSE from a CCNA. Don’t hide your strong points in language that no one outside your field can understand. 

4. Ease up on the technical details. Remember, you’re in management now, and even though your tech skills got you where you are, it’s a different skill set that will propel you forward. Yes, you can—and should—list your technical skills, but make sure the focus is on how those skills help you manage people and technology more effectively.

5. Stress benefits, not features. Think back to your days as a hardware engineer, for example. Did you stress that the chip you designed replaced up to 10 discrete components or did you stress the greater product functionality and smaller device sizes that your customers could enjoy when they used your chip in their devices? Now, apply that logic to your resume. Don’t just say that you devised a new off-site backup strategy for the company. Point out that your off-site backup strategy reduced hardware and labor expenses by more than 50 percent, reduced downtime substantially, and increased client satisfaction 100 percent.

6. Put the bottom line on top. Translate each of your accomplishments into hours saved, money earned, and other tangible results for the company. If you can’t figure out how the things you do every day fit into the big picture, you’re doing something wrong. If you know what the moneymaking tasks are and you’re not finding time for them, you also need to reprioritize. Your resume should reflect the net worth you add to your organization.

7. Ask someone nontechnical to read your resume. If someone who isn’t especially tech savvy can read your resume and get a sense of what you do and why someone might hire you, your resume is definitely on the right track. If that person can also proofread, have them do it and your resume will quickly be ready for prime time.
