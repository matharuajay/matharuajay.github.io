<span style="font-family: Garamond;font-size:14px;"><span><strong>Jack Palance:  “Do you know what the secret of life is?  One thing.  Just one thing.  You stick to that and everything else don’t mean shit.”<br /> Billy Crystal:   ”Yeah, but what’s that one thing?”<br /> Jack Palance:  “That’s what you’ve got to figure out.”</strong></span></span>
