>   &#8220;Whatever our individual troubles and challenges may be, it&#8217;s important to pause every now and then to appreciate all that we have, on every level. We need to literally &#8220;count our blessings,&#8221; give thanks for them, allow ourselves to enjoy them, and relish the experience of prosperity we already have.&#8221;
