**1) How you think is everything:**Remember to think &#8220;POSITIVE&#8221; at every opportunity. Visualize success, not failure. Avoid negative environments and people. You are what you think. In fact, study shows that positive thinking actually increases longevity.

**2) Decide on your dreams and goals:** Be specific about your goals. For example, say &#8220;I am taking music class next month,&#8221; rather than &#8220;I would like to take a music class sometime.&#8221; Create a plan to reach your goals, and stick to it.

**3) Take action:** Goals alone have no meaning. You need to take action to make them real. Don&#8217;t let fear hold you back. &#8220;Just Do it.&#8221;

**4) Never stop learning:** Take classes, go back to school, read books, join a discussion group. If you are interested in a asubject, make time to learn about it. Keep acquiring new skills.

**5) Be persistent and work hard:** You&#8217;ve probably heard the expression, &#8220;success is a marathon, not a sprint.&#8221; Keep your eye on the goal, and keep working towards it. Don&#8217;t give up.

**6) Learn to analyse details:** Get all the facts, and ask for input. This will help you make wiser decisions. Acknowledge your mistakes, but don&#8217;t beat yourself up. Learn from your mistakes.

**7) Focus your time and money:** When you believe in something, put your attention and energy there. Don&#8217;t let others distract you.

**8) Don&#8217;t be afraid do innovate; be different:** Be true to yourself, and have your own ideas. Following the crowd is a path to mediocrity.

**9) Communicate with people effectively:** Remember that no person is an island. Communicate your thoughts and desires honestly, and encourage other to communicate honestly with you. Practice understanding and motivating other people.

**10) Be honest and dependable; take responsibility for what you do:** Never cheat or lie. When you make a promise, keep it. When you screw up, admit it. Without honesty dependability and responsibility, the other nine secrets of success don&#8217;t add up to much.
