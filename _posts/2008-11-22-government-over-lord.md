I just saw this story and felt like sharing this with you guys, its about how Lord himself thinks that Government is over Lord,

In the year 2008, the Lord came unto Noah,

who was now living in the United States, and said:
  
&#8220;Once again, the earth has become wicked and over
  
-populated, and I see the end of all flesh before me.&#8221;

&#8220;Build another Ark and save 2 of every <span class="yshortcuts">living thing</span>
  
along with a few good humans.&#8221;

He gave Noah the blueprints, saying:
  
&#8220;You have 6 months to build the Ark before I will
  
start the unending rain for 40 days and 40 nights.&#8221;

Six months later, the Lord looked down and saw Noah
  
weeping in his yard &#8211; but no Ark.

&#8220;Noah!,&#8221; He roared, &#8220;I&#8217;m about to start the rain!
  
Where is the Ark?&#8221;

&#8220;Forgive me, Lord,&#8221; begged Noah, &#8220;but things have changed.&#8221;

&#8220;I needed a building permit.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ve been arguing with the inspector
  
about the need for a sprinkler system.&#8221;

&#8220;My neighbors claim that I&#8217;ve violated the
  
neighborhood zoning laws by building the Ark in my
  
yard and exceeding the height limitations. We had to
  
go to the Development Appeal Board for a decision.&#8221;

&#8220;Then the <span class="yshortcuts">Department of Transportation</span> demanded a
  
bond be posted for the future costs of moving power
  
lines and other overhead obstructions, to clear the
  
passage for the Ark&#8217;s move to the sea. I told them
  
that the sea would be coming to us, but they would
  
hear nothing of it.&#8221;

&#8220;Getting the wood was another problem. There&#8217;s a ban
  
on cutting local trees in order to save the <span class="yshortcuts">spotted owl</span>.&#8221;

&#8220;I tried to convince the environmentalists that I
  
needed the wood to save the owls &#8211; but no go!&#8221;

&#8220;When I started gathering the animals, an animal
  
rights group sued me. They insisted that I was
  
confining <span class="yshortcuts" style="cursor:hand;border-bottom:#0066cc 1px dashed;">wild animals</span> against their will. They
  
argued the accommodations were too restrictive, and
  
it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in
  
a confined space.&#8221;

&#8220;Then the EPA ruled that I couldn&#8217;t build the Ark
  
until they&#8217;d conducted an environmental impact study
  
on your proposed flood.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m still trying to resolve a complaint with the
  
<span class="yshortcuts">Human Rights Commission</span> on how many minorities I&#8217;m
  
supposed to hire for my building crew.&#8221;

&#8220;Immigration and Naturalization are checking the
  
green-card status of most of the people who want to work.&#8221;

&#8220;The trades unions say I can&#8217;t use my sons. They
  
insist I have to hire only Union workers with
  
Ark-building experience.&#8221;

&#8220;To make matters worse, the IRS seized all my assets,
  
claiming I&#8217;m trying to leave the country illegally
  
with <span class="yshortcuts">endangered species</span>.&#8221;

&#8220;So, forgive me, Lord, but it would take at least 10
  
years for me to finish this Ark.&#8221;

&#8220;Suddenly the skies cleared, the sun began to shine,
  
and a rainbow stretched across the sky.&#8221;

Noah looked up in wonder and asked,
  
&#8220;You mean you&#8217;re not going to destroy the world?&#8221;

&#8220;No,&#8221; said the Lord.
  
&#8220;The GOVERNMENT beat me to it.&#8221;
