Details are scarce, unless Russian is your language of choice, but CNews is reporting that Russia plans to develop its own national operating system. The move is designed to reduce Russia&#8217;s need to rely on foreign software and licensing agreements. And the alleged &#8220;open code&#8221; solution, likely a Linux/GNU derivative, will give Russia a greater degree of customization, as well as increased control over how the potentially free OS is used and accessed.

This isn&#8217;t the first time Russia has dabbled with the idea of widespread open-source software distribution. According to Russia Today, <a href="http://www.russiatoday.com/news/news/22094" target="_blank">a pilot program is already underway</a> in three Russian regions to replace Microsoft-branded operating systems in Russian schools with Linux alternatives. All Russian schools are expected to make the software switch by 2009, <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Russian-Linux-Will-Be-Installed-In-Every-School-66072.shtml" target="_blank">according to Russian leaders</a>.

Expect the national transition to put a large feather in the cap of Linux advocates worldwide. But will it spurn increased U.S. adoption of the open-source OS? The economic crisis might be more fuel for that fire. A <a href="http://www.omni-ts.com/linux-desktop/education.html" target="_blank">&#8220;free the penguin&#8221; initiative</a> aimed at increasing Linux adoption in U.S. academic institutions signed up more than 3,000 interested schools between September and December of 2008&#8211;that&#8217;s 20,000 new open-source desktops across 29 separate states.
