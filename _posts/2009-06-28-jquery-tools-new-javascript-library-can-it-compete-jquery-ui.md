These days almost every site uses JQuery. It makes your life so easy. There is this another Javascript library called JQuery Tools that is coming up as competitor for JQuery UI. Here is the link to the JQuery Tool https://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/index.html.

But the question, for which I am searching the answer is,
  
Can JQuery Tools really compete with JQuery UI? And who would answer this question better then you guys.

So what you guys think, JQuery Tools Vs JQuery UI, who wins?

I look forward for hearing your thoughts on this. As this may help others to decide what should they go from either of these
