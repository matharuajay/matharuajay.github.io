<p style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;">
  One of my friends mailed me this story n after reading this story I was amazed and really proved one famous saying <strong>&#8220;NEVER JUDGE THE BOOK FROM IT&#8217;S COVER PAGE!!&#8221;</strong> and in fact it&#8217;s a true story&#8230;
</p>

<p style="margin:0;">
  <strong> </strong>
</p>

<p style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;">
  A lady in a gingham dress and her husband, dressed in a homespun threadbare suit, stepped off the train in Boston. They walked timidly without an appointment into the president of Harvard University&#8217;s outer office.
</p>

<p style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;">
  The secretary determined in a moment that such backwoods, country hicks had no business at Harvard and probably didn&#8217;t even deserve to be in Cambridge. She frowned.
</p>

<p style="margin:0;">
  &#8220;We want to see the president,&#8221; the man said softly. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be busy all day,&#8221; the secretary snapped. &#8220;We&#8217;ll wait,&#8221; the lady replied.
</p>

<p style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;">
  For hours, the secretary ignored them, hoping that the couple would finally become discouraged and go away. They didn&#8217;t. The secretary grew frustrated and finally decided to disturb the president, even though it was a chore she always regretted to do.
</p>

<p style="margin:0;">
  &#8220;Maybe if they just see you for a few minutes, they&#8217;ll leave,&#8221; she told him.
</p>

<p style="margin:0;">
  The President sighed in exasperation and nodded. Someone of his importance obviously didn&#8217;t have the time to spend with them, but he detested the thought of gingham dresses and homespun suits cluttering up his outer office.
</p>

<p style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;">
  The president, stern-faced with dignity, strutted toward the couple. The lady told him, &#8220;We had a son that attended Harvard for one year. He loved Harvard. He was happy here. But about a year ago, he was accidentally killed. My husband and I would like to erect a memorial to him, somewhere on campus.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;">
  The president was not touched by her story, he was shocked. &#8220;Madam,&#8221; he said gruffly. &#8220;We can&#8217;t put up a statue for every student from Harvard who died. If we did, this place would look like a cemetery.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;">
  &#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; the lady explained quickly. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to erect a statute. We thought we would like to give a building to Harvard.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;">
  The president rolled his eyes. He glanced at the gingham dress and homespun suit, then exclaimed. &#8220;A building? Do you have any earthly idea how much a building costs? We have over seven and a half million dollars in the physical plant at Harvard.&#8221; He could get rid of them now.
</p>

<p style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;">
  And the lady turned to her husband and said quietly, &#8220;Is that all it costs to start a University? Why don&#8217;t we just start our own?&#8221; Her husband nodded. The president&#8217;s face wilted in confusion and bewilderment.
</p>

<p style="text-indent:.5in;margin:0;">
  Mr. and Mrs. Leland Stanford walked away, travelled to Palo Alto, California where they established the University that bears their name, a memorial to a son that Harvard no longer cared about.
