Microsoft on Friday said that it  <a href="http://www.popfly.com/" target="_blank">may discontinue its free Popfly service </a> that lets non-programmers build Web 2.0 apps.

Popfly &#8220;is in a transitional phase,&#8221; said a Microsoft spokeswoman on Friday. &#8220;We have no other details at the moment.&#8221;

A free programming tool built on Microsoft&#8217;s Silverlight rich media platform, Popfly lets novice coders build powerful Web 2.0 apps or casual games simply by dragging and dropping pre-built services such as RSS or Flickr image feeds, all represented on the screen as icons or blocks.
