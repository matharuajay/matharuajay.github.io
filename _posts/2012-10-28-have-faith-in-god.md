Once God have given some work to his messenger. The messenger went and completed the work and was returning.

While messenger was returning he met a King. He asked the king do you have any message for GOD? King replied, &#8220;my life is messed up and my country is not doing good, can you ask God to look into this&#8221;. The messenger took the message and moved forward.

Messenger then on the way met a beggar. He asked the beggar do you have any message for GOD? beggar replied, &#8220;Tell GOD I haven&#8217;t received my lunch yet&#8221;. The messenger took the message and moved forward.

Finally messenger met GOD, gave him the final status of the work given to him. He then conveyed the messages of king and beggar to GOD. After hearing the messages GOD replied, &#8220;Ohh!! I forgot about the beggar please make some arrangement for his lunch.

The messenger got shocked as GOD was not concerned about the king but was very concerned about the beggar. With great curiosity he asked GOD, &#8220;Why you haven&#8217;t addressed king concerns and are so worried about the beggar?&#8221;.

God replied, &#8220;to know the answer you have to go back and say what I say to them. Their response will give you the answer to your question.&#8221;

The messenger then went back to king and told him &#8220;God said, he can pass a camel from the needle hole&#8221;. The king replied, &#8220;How&#8217;s that possible. No, that&#8217;s not possible at all&#8221;

The messenger then went to beggar and told him same thing. He said, &#8220;God said, he can pass a camel from the needle hole&#8221;. Beggar replied, &#8220;Big deal, he&#8217;s GOD he can do anything and everything&#8221;.

These replies helped messenger realize why GOD was concerned about beggar but not king.
