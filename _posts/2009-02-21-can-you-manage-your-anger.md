There are two type of angry people explosive and implosive;

Explosive is the type of individual you see screaming at the cashier for not taking his coupons. Implosive is the cashier who remains quiet day after day and then finally shoots everyone in the store.

Don&#8217;t get mad, don&#8217;t get even and learn to calm down. How ever this is difficult to do when your boss asks for a report way before the deadline. Experts tend to believe that anger is merely the symptom of a far deeper problem.

Some people are just chronically angry and in the habit of being angry. Giving in to their demands like offering an alcoholic drink. If you scratch below the surface, there&#8217;s a lot of pain and hurt that needs to be addressed.

When an emotion begins to hamper you and your family life, it&#8217;s time to seek the help of a counsellor. We should learn from our mistakes and cut down on expectations which set us up for disappointments.

Control anger before it controls you. Instead of slamming the door when you&#8217;re angry or throwing knives, learn to approach the problem in a straightforward manner.

Underneath every anger lies fear. Anger is nothing but a defence mechanism. An angry, young man is not charming; what you should aim for is a build-up of contagious energy, where you are contained and in acceptance of everything about yourself, including the emotion of anger.

**Tips to manage Anger**

&#8211; Relax, think of a place or a time that you particularly enjoy.

&#8211; Counting from 50 backwards shifts brain activity from the emotional to the analytical part of the brain, decreasing the intensity of the unwanted emotion.

&#8211; Laugh often and watch movies that tickle your funny bone.

&#8211; Don&#8217;t jump to conclusions. Listen to others.

&#8211; Instead of revisiting hurtful events in your mind, forgive the person who wronged you.

&#8211; Have a healthy diet. Adequate vitamins are vital for your body.

&#8211; With children, don&#8217;t over stimulate them with school, hobbies and tennis lessons. A child needs time to relax.
