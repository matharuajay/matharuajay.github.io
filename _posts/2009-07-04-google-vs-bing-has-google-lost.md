Have you heard the news? Microsoft&#8217;s Bing is taking a bite out of Google, boasting first-month market share gains while the competition&#8217;s stronghold slips away! At least, that&#8217;s what some headlines around the Web might lead you to believe this week.

The truth, though, is that the change is not nearly as dramatic as it appears at a glance. While Bing has, according to certain data, minimally increased Microsoft&#8217;s search market share, Google&#8217;s position has not significantly shifted.

**Bing vs. Google: The Buzz**

All the buzz comes from a new search market analysis by Web stats company StatCounter. Bing, the researchers say, secured 8.23 percent of all U.S.-based searches for the month of June. (Bing officially launched on June 3.) The previous month, StatCounter shows Microsoft sitting at 7.81 percent of U.S. searches. That amounts to a month-to-month increase of just under half a percentage point following Bing&#8217;s debut.

Google, during that same time span, dropped from 78.72 percent to 78.48 of U.S. searches &#8212; a decrease of 0.24 percent, according to StatCounter&#8217;s data. Looking back to April, the difference becomes slightly less apt to be obliterated by a sneeze: Google&#8217;s two-month drop amounts to 0.59 percent, while Microsoft&#8217;s April-to-June gain comes out to 1.02 percent.
