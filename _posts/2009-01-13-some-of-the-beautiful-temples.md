Wat Rong Khun is a contemporary unconventional buddhist temple in Chiang Rai, Thailand. Wat Rong Khun is different from any other temple in Thailand, as its ubosot (Pali: uposatha; consecrated assembly hall) is designed in white color with some use of white glass. The white color stands for Lord Buddha’s purity; the white glass stands for Lord Buddha’s wisdom that &#8220;shines brightly all over the Earth and the Universe.&#8221;
