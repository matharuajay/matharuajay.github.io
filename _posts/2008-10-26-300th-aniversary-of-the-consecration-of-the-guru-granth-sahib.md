Guru Nanak founded Sikhism in the fifteenth century, and he was ofllowed by nine gurus. The tenth and last Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, named the Guru Granth Sahib &#8211;Â  the Holy Book of the Sikhs &#8211; as the next permanent Sikh Guru. The Holy Book is written is ragas, and preaches equality and peaceful existance, irrespective of differences in caste and creed.

Gur-ta-Gaddi marks the 300th anniversary of the censecration of Guru Granth Sahib as the eternal guru of the Sikhs.

God does not encourage hatred; instead, His message is that of love; to help people in need. Our religion teaches us to live in peace and harmony, help others, and fight for justice, even if we have to scrifice our lives.

Guru Nanak was against conversion, and he preached that all religions are equal and sacred. He preached that we should donate at least 10% of our income to charity.

Guru Gobind Singh conferred the Holy Book, the Granth Sahib, with the title of Guru, because he could foresee that a time would come when there would be fights and quarrels fot he seat of the Guru.

He wanted the Sikhs to remain united and live in harmony with each other. To protect the rights of teh common man, our worthy Gurus took the responsibility to safeguard the interest of the common man.
