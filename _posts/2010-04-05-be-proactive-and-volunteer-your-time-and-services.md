Don&#8217;t wait to give of yourself. Be proactive and volunteer your time and services, go and help someone who is stuck, try not to wait until you are asked to do something before doing it.

This will be a win-win situation for you as well as the recipient. The person for whom you are giving or doing will feel better that you are doing so without him/her needing to ask. You will feel simply better for doing it.

A nice easy example is a little boy who cleans his room without his mom asking him. He gets to beÂ  proud for cleaning without being asked, and the Mom is proud that she did not need to prod her son into doing his chores.
  
The same hold true for adults. Step up and give before you are asked. See what happens.

Be Well.
