Another most common gripe with laptop users is that its juice runs out when you need it. So a good home remedy is to remove the battery from your laptop when you are using the AC power exclusively. This reduces constant charging/recharging of the battery. Maintaining the battery at full charge for extended periods can shorten its service life. Should you opt not to remove the batteries but run the laptop so that it is nearly always plugged in, it&#8217;s good idea to remove the charger cord frequently &#8211; atleast once a week &#8211; and run the laptop off battery charge for an hour or two.

Similar is with your iPod, If your IPod&#8217;s battery stubbornly refuses to charge or doesn&#8217;t charge completely, try making the battery completely dry. Next, simply pull out the battery from the iPod and leave it outside for 24 hours. Plug it back and notice the difference.
