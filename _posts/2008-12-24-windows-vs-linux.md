<p style="text-align:left;">
  Microsoft has long been worried about Linux competition in the server market. When it came to ordinary PCs and laptops, however, it knew it had little to fear.
</p>

But that was then. Now Microsoft may fear Linux on the desktop as much as it does the Mac. It&#8217;s finally taking Linux seriously as a desktop operating system, and it has designed Windows 7 to kill it.

The threat to Windows comes entirely from &#8220;netbooks&#8221; &#8212; lightweight, inexpensive laptops that typically use Intel &#8216;s low-powered Atom processor and don&#8217;t come with substantial amounts of RAM or powerful graphics processors. They&#8217;re designed mainly for browsing the Web, handling e-mail, writing memos, and taking care of simple word-processing or spreadsheet chores.

Clearly, the future is in netbooks. And that has Microsoft worried. Netbooks can&#8217;t handle Vista&#8217;s hardware demands, so XP is the only Microsoft operating system that runs on them. But Linux is ideally suited for lower-powered notebooks.

The result? Acer and Asustek, which account for 90% of the netbook market, are using Linux on about 30% of their low-cost notebooks, according to Bloomberg. Making matters worse, if Linux is used on those netbooks, it means that Microsoft Office isn&#8217;t. So Microsoft takes a double hit every time someone buys a Linux netbook.

Microsoft isn&#8217;t just worried about ceding 30% of the netbook market to Linux. It&#8217;s also worried that if people get used to running Linux on netbooks, they&#8217;ll consider buying Linux on desktop PCs as well.

Microsoft, though, has a not-so-secret weapon against Linux: Windows 7. Its new operating system, slated to be introduced sometime next year, is designed to work fine on netbooks. In fact, at Microsoft&#8217;s recent Professional Developers Conference, where the pre-beta of Windows 7 was unveiled, Windows Senior Vice President Steve Sinofsky showed off Windows 7 on his Lenovo S10 and said it used less than half of the netbook&#8217;s 1GB of RAM.

When Windows 7 ships, expect a massive marketing blitz pushing it on netbooks with special deals, and netbook hardware taking advantage of Windows 7 capabilities, including touch screens.

In fact, the blitz has already begun. Asus CEO Jerry Shen announced that he plans to release versions of the Eee PC powered by Windows 7 in mid-2009, including a touch-screen version.

Despite Microsoft&#8217;s killer instincts, I don&#8217;t think Linux netbook sales will stop dead. There will always be a niche for them. But within a year of the Windows 7 launch, Linux market share will drop. The high point for Linux netbook sales will be from now until the launch of Windows 7. After that will come the inevitable decline.
