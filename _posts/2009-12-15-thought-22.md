&#8220;Throw your heart over the fence and the rest will follow.&#8221;

&#8211; Norman Vincent Peale

Like yesterday&#8217;s Quote, today&#8217;s is about being grateful and having your attitude affect your entire day. When you do a task with love, everything will be much better. Show the gratitude you feel towards someone and the relationship will blossom.
