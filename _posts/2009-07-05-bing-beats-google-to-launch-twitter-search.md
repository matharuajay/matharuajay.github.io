Day before I posted about <a href="http://www.ajaymatharu.com/2009/07/03/google-vs-bing-has-google-lost/" target="_blank">Bing Vs Google</a>, this is certainly one area where Microsoft Bing has outdone Google.

Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Bing has beaten Google Inc. to the punch.

Google has been rumored to be casting an eye toward creating a tool for searching social networking sites, like Twitter. But today, Bing came out and did it.

When someone does a search on Bing for Al Gore in association with Twitter, for instance, the user should see Gore&#8217;s latest tweets come up among the search results.

If online chatter succeeds, Bing won&#8217;t be alone for long in offering this Twitter-search feature.

A possible Google microblogging search service that would focus on finding Twitter posts has been the subject of online chatter in recent weeks.
