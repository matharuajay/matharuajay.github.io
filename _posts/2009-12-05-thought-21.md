&#8220;The unthankful heart&#8230; discovers no mercies; but let the thankful heart sweep through the day and, as the magnet finds the iron, so it will find, in every hour, some heavenly blessings.&#8221;

&#8211; Henry Ward Beecher

When you look for things, they will appear. If you are unthankful or if you are not grateful, the world around you will be miserable. If you are full of gratitude and thankful for what you have, the world will be a wonderful place to be in! Which world do you want to be in today?
