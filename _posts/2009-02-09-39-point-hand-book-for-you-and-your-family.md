<span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif';">1.       Drink plenty of water.<br /> 2.       Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a beggar.<br /> 3.       Eat more foods that grow on trees and plants and eat less food that is manufactured in plants.<br /> 4.       Live with the 3 E&#8217;s &#8212; Energy, Enthusiasm, and Empathy.<br /> 5.       Make time to practice meditation, yoga, and prayer.<br /> 6.       Play more games.<br /> 7.       Read more books than you did in 2008.<br /> 8.       Sit in silence for at least 10 minutes each day.<br /> 9.       Sleep for 7 hours.<br /> 10.    Take a 10-30 minutes walk every day. And while you walk, smile. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif';">11.    Don&#8217;t compare your life to others&#8217;. You have no idea what their journey is all about.<br /> 12.    Don&#8217;t have negative thoughts or things you cannot control. Instead invest your energy in the positive present moment.<br /> 13.    Don&#8217;t over do. Keep your limits.<br /> 14.    Don&#8217;t take yourself so seriously. No one else does.<br /> 15.    Don&#8217;t waste your precious energy on gossip.<br /> 16.    Dream more while you are awake.<br /> 17.    Envy is a waste of time. You already have all you need.<br /> 18.    Forget issues of the past. Don&#8217;t remind your partner with his/her mistakes of the past. That will ruin your present happiness.<br /> 19.    Life is too short to waste time hating anyone. Don&#8217;t hate others.<br /> 20.    Make peace with your past so it won&#8217;t spoil the present.<br /> 21.    No one is in charge of your happiness except you.<br /> 22.    Realize that life is a school and you are here to learn. Problems are simply part of the curriculum that appear and fade away like algebra class but the lessons you learn         will last a lifetime.<br /> 23.    Smile and laugh more.<br /> 24.    You don&#8217;t have to win every argument. Agree to disagree. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif';">25.    Call your family often.<br /> 26.    Each day give something good to others.<br /> 27.    Forgive everyone for everything.<br /> 28.    Spend time with people over the age of 70 & under the age of 6.<br /> 29.    Try to make at least three people smile each day.<br /> 30.    What other people think of you is none of your business.<br /> 31.    Your job won&#8217;t take care of you when you are sick. Your friends will. Stay in touch. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif';">32.    Do the right thing!<br /> 33.    Get rid of anything that isn&#8217;t useful, beautiful or joyful.<br /> 34.    GOD heals everything.<br /> 35.    However good or bad a situation is, it will change.<br /> 36.    No matter how you feel, get up, dress up and show up.<br /> 37.    The best is yet to come.<br /> 38.    When you awake alive in the morning, thank GOD for it.<br /> 39.    Your Inner most is always happy. So, be happy. </span></span>
