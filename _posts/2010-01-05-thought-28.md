Do you constantly think of the things that you do not have? Are you always concentrating on something you want? If so, you will never feel satisfied &#8211; you will always be looking and hoping for &#8220;someday&#8221; to be here. &#8220;Someday I will have that boat.&#8221; Someday I will have that new car, that new job, etc.&#8221;
  
Take time out and think about all that you do have! Be grateful for what you are in control of. Rejoice for having whatever you have, great or small! You will find yourself much more happier this way!
