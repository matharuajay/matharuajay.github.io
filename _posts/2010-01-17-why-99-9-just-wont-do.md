&#8220;When it comes to quality, 99.9% just isn&#8217;t good enough.&#8221; Is 99.9% a reasonable goal? What does it mean?

If all things in life were done right 99.9% of the time, this is what we would have to accept:

* 1 hour of unsafe drinking water every month.
  
* 2 unsafe plane landings per day.
  
* 16,000 pieces of mail lost by the Post Office every hour.
  
* 20,000 incorrect prescriptions every year.
  
* 500 incorrect operations each week.
  
* 50 babies dropped at birth every day.
  
* 22,000 checks deducted from the wrong bank account each hour.
  
* 32,000 missed heartbeats per person each year.

Suddenly the quest for &#8220;zero defects&#8221; makes a lot of sense!

So if you want something, and you putting in 99.9% of your efforts, it won&#8217;t just do.
  
If you really want 100% result you need to put 100% efforts
