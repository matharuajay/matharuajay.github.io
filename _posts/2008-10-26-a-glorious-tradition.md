It falls on the 13th lunar day in the Hindu calendar month of Kartik. People of the Hindu faith wake up very early on this day and start preparations for worship and bathing rituals. They clean their homes and shops, decorate entrances with garlands of mango leaves and marigold flowers, draw rangoliss on doorways to welcome the Goddess. Diyas are arranged in and around the houses, which are to be lit in the evening.

Since this day of Diwali is associated with &#8216;dhan&#8217; or wealth, people buy gold and silver jewellery, new utensils, clothes and other such items. Coins, representing wealth, are also worshipped in the evening.
