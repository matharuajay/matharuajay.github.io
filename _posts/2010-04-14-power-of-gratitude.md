Imagine if the word Gratitude was not included in the above quote. Instead, think of a blank \___\___\___\___ in its place. Go back and re-read the quote picturing the word Gratitude as a blank.

Suppose you had no idea what it was that could bring so much goodness to your life. I am sure you would want to know what it is! You might even be sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to find out what the missing blank is.

I would bet that once you found out what it was (i.e., gratitude) that you might feel a twinge of disappointment. You might be expecting some grandiose &#8220;thing&#8221; to provide all that it promises.
  
Why does it have to be difficult? What do people have a hard time accepting that something as simple as gratitude can bring you so much goodness? Can you just accept it and enjoy? 

Things that make you go Hmmmmm&#8230;

Be Well.
