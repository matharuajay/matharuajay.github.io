  <div>
    <strong>Q) Will service center guys know if I&#8217;ve rooted my device?</strong>

  <div>
    <strong>Q) What are the benefits or rooting my device?</strong>
  </div>

    A) You open up lot of options when you root your device.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    &#8211; You can remove all unwanted crappy pre-installed apps from your device.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    &#8211; Install custom roms which allow you to take full advantage of your device.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    &#8211; Customize your device way you want it to.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    &#8211; Stop unwanted background battery consuming service which you dont use at all.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    &#8211; Overclock (increase processor speed) and underclock (save battery) your device
  </div>
  
  <div>
    &#8211; and lot more
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <strong>Q) Where will I get help to root my device?</strong>

  <div>
    A) The best place to get help to root your device is <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/" target="_blank">XDA forum</a>. You should head over to xda, search your device and get started. If you find difficulty in finding a way to root your device, just drop a comment.

  </div>
  
  <div>
    <strong>Q) I think, I should root my device after my warranty period?</strong>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    A) Lot of my friends think that its better to root the device after your warranty period. But I think you should root your device while in warranty period. You can get service on your device in warranty period. Just remember to unroot your device before taking it to service center Its that simple.
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <strong>Q) What are the drawbacks of rooting the device?</strong>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    A) After looking at the good side of rooting lets see at the dark side of it. There are chances that you may damage your android device by doing something. Again remember just rooting and uninstalling bloatware does not damage your device.
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    For e.g. I remember the first day I bought Galaxy Note, I rooted my device, installed recovery and cleaned system and data partition. This cleaning damaged my mother board and my device was hard brick because there was bug in samsung that if you clean system partition it damages emmc (internal memory). I took my device to service center and said its not starting, Its having this problem after I tried to update and they could not figure out that it was because I did that.
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I understand these are very basic questions, but these are important to help you get started. If you are stuck anywhere in any device. Just drop a comment and I&#8217;ll try to help you out.
