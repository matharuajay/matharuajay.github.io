The best performers in business don&#8217;t hide behind their desks. They know that business is all about connecting to people. When people like you and know you and trust you, they will help you. That&#8217;s just the way it is. Human nature at play.

The best managers get out from behind their desks and have rich and meaningful converstations with their teams. Such passion is contagious. Before someon will lend you their hand, you need to touch their heart. The best salespeople get out from behind eheir desks and break bread with their customers.

They understand the power of relationship-selling. People don&#8217;t buy products and services &#8211; they buy people and relationships. the best employees get out from behind their desks to collaborate with their team-mates, support their colleagues and to spread their enthusiasm.
