&#8220;There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.&#8221;

&#8212; Albert Einstein

Take a moment and stop and think about 3 things that you take for granted. How did it get there? What if it was not there? Do you see what a miracle it is?
