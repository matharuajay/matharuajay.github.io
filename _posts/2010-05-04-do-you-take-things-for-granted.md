> &#8220;And the things you take for granted Turn out to be the things that you need.&#8221;

You are reading this at some point of the day. For some it is early in the morning for you. For others, you are in the middle of the day. Regardless of how much of your day you have been through, what have you already taken for granted? What have you not thought about at all, yet was very important in your day? Could it be you car that brought you to work? Or perhaps the bus driver who drove you? Did you think twice about the coffee maker this morning? Or maybe the copy machine for duplicating your papers.

Trivial things? Perhaps they are. Without them, you would not be where you are right now. Shouldn&#8217;t you be grateful for them?
  
Try going the rest of the day and think about what it is &#8216;right now&#8217; that you almost took for granted&#8230;

What a fun game!

Be Well.
