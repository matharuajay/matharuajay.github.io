  We all get mental blocks. We need to get unblocked. The<span> </span>way to get unblocked is to lose our inhibitions and stop worrying about being right.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  The comedian John Cleese puts it rather more eloquently, ‘High creativity is responding to situations without critical thought’.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  If you are in deadlock here are a couple of tricks you might try.
</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent: -18pt;">
  <span><span>&#8211;<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none;"> </span></span></span>Do the opposite of what the solution requires.
</p>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Look out of the window and whatever catches your eye, a bird, a television aerial, an old man on crutches or whatever, make that the solution to your problem.</span>
