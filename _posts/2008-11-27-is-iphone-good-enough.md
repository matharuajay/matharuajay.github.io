The U.K.&#8217;s advertising regulator banned a video advertisement for Apple&#8217;s 3G iPhone, saying Wednesday that the ad exaggerates the phone&#8217;s speed and is misleading.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 17 complaints about the advertisement, which shows a person whizzing through tasks such as opening a news page in a browser, using Google Maps and downloading a file.

All of the tasks &#8220;had waiting times of only a fraction of a second,&#8221; the ASA said in a statement. A voice over says no less than five times that the 3G iPhone is &#8220;really fast.&#8221;

In response, Apple told the ASA that the claim is a comparison between the 3G and 2G iPhone models, and that users would understand that performance could vary. The ad did include a text disclaimer that read &#8220;Network performance will vary by location.&#8221;

However, the ASA found that the snappy visuals combined with the repetition of &#8220;really fast&#8221; would &#8220;lead viewers to conclude that the device actually operated at or near to the speeds shown in the ad.&#8221;

Also, not all mobile phone users may be aware of the differences between 2G and 3G technology, ASA said.

Apple did not have an immediate comment on the ruling.
