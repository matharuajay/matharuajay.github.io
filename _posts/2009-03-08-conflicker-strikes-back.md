The Conficker/Downadup worm managed to slither onto millions of PCs worldwide at its height, but after it initially infected a computer it only really acted to spread itself, and didn&#8217;t cause further harm. Until now.

Symantec reports today that it has found a new variant of the virulent worm that will identify antivirus software or security analysis tools running on the infected PC, and attempt to shut down those programs. This is a strong signal that the worm&#8217;s mysterious creators haven&#8217;t abandoned their creation in the face of worldwide attention, as some in the industry have theorized, but may still have plans to make a buck off their work.

To protect against the Conficker worm, first make sure you&#8217;ve installed the patch that closes a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS08-067.mspx" target="_blank">targeted hole in the Microsoft Server Service</a>. Next, protect any network shares and administrator accounts with a strong password, as Conficker will try to guess easy ones.

Finally, you can block the worm&#8217;s third infection, which hijacks thumb drives and other removeable media, by disabling Autorun on Windows. PC World has a <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fid,76805-page,1/description.html?tk=rel_news" target="_blank">download available</a> that can automate that step for Windows XP users, and Microsoft has posted <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953252" target="_blank">manual instructions</a>.
