Yesterday I posted on Team Building, I mentioned in that post that I&#8217;ll post about the tasks one by one later. So here I am with the first task for my Team Building workshop.

This task is named &#8220;Rabbit, Archer or Wall&#8221;

&#8211; In this there are two teams.

&#8211; Each team has to choose the character they want to be they can either be Rabbit or Archer or Wall

&#8211; All the team members have to be same character, so the character has to be told to everyone in the team. The team here decides what they want to be.

&#8211; Both teams are given 30 seconds to decide who they are.

&#8211; After 30 seconds both team face each other and do the respective action.

&#8211; For Rabbit action is &#8220;Hands on ear&#8221;, for Archer the action is &#8220;Archer releasing arrow&#8221;, and for Wall the action is both Hands with the palm facing the other team.

&#8211; When Rabbit comes in front of Archer &#8211; Archer wins (Archer kills Rabbit)

&#8211; When Rabbit comes in front of Wall &#8211; Rabbit wins (Rabbit jumps over Wall)

&#8211; When Wall comes in front of Archer &#8211; Wall wins (Wall falls on Archer)

In this you can have 5 iterations which yields you the result.

Things team learn in this task,

&#8211; Communicating the character (action) to all the members.

&#8211; Improved co-ordination among team members as all the members are told to do the same action.

&#8211; Improved understanding among team members.

&#8211; Chance for team members to place their opinion, get togerther and discuss what action to perform.

&#8211; Improves teamwork and team comes together to achieve success and win.

I&#8217;ll post the other two exercises that we had very soon. Keep checking.
