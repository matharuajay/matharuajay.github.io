This is an amazing story of the 99 club.

There was one king, since he had lots of responsibilities he was always stressed. He used to see a farmer who was very happy. He was very happy with his farming and family, he had no stress, he used to work hard but enjoy his work and was contented with his life.

King always wondered how can this farmer be so contented, even after he doesn&#8217;t have luxurious life. The king asked this his minister to find out the reason behind the farmer&#8217;s containment.

The minister observed that the farmer was happy because he didn&#8217;t had anything to worry about. He used to work hard, to earn his bread and butter and because he worked hard he got better sleep. He was happy with his family and farming.

The minister then kept a small bag with 99 gold coins outside his house. Next day when the farmer saw the bag he was ecstatic. He began to count them. After several counts, he was at last convinced that there were 99 coins. &#8216;What could&#8217;ve happened to that last gold coin? Surely, no one would leave 99 coins!&#8217; he wondered. He looked everywhere he could, but that final coin was elusive. Finally, exhausted, he decided that he would have to work harder than ever to earn that gold coin and complete his collection.

From that day he started to work really hard and hard, and could not give enough attention to his family. He was completely focused on earning that one more coin. He stopped enjoying his work. The king observed this and asked his minister what happened to him, why is he no more contented? The minister replied that he has joined our club of 99.

The 99 club is a name given to those people who have enough to be happy but are never contented because they&#8217;re always striving for that extra one. They always tell themselves, &#8220;Let me get that final one and then I&#8217;ll be happy for life&#8221;.

We can be happy even with very little in our life, but the minute we&#8217;re given something bigger and better, we want more!!! We lose our sleep, our happiness, we hurt the people around us. We lose all this at a price of our growing greed and desire.
