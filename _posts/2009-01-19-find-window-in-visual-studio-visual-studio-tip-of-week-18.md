Normally when you use &#8220;ctrl + f&#8221; and search for results, you have to navigate one by one in every file where the searched string exists. There is an alternative to this rather than navigating one by one you can have all the results in your &#8220;find window&#8221;.

press ctrl + shft + f

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-794" title="find" src="http://ajaymatharu.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/find.jpg" alt="find" width="346" height="487" />

you can search for the string and the result will be displayed in the Find window

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-797" title="find-result2" src="http://ajaymatharu.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/find-result2.jpg" alt="find-result2" width="500" height="207" />

you can click on the search result line to navigate to that part.

This is extremely helpful when you want all your results to be listed in a find window rather then to navigate one by one in every file where the searched string exists.
