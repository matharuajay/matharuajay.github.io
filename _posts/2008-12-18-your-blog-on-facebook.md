Blogging just got more social: Facebook has launched its Connect Plugin Directory in addition to its Connect program. If you&#8217;re a blogger, that means you can let your visitors comment on your site using their Facebook credentials. If you&#8217;re a reader, once you comment using your Facebook details, you can have the comment automatically published on your Facebook newsfeed.

Facebook launched almost two weeks ago the Connect program, that lets [websites authenticate](http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Facebook_Connect_Live_Sites) users with their Facebook login credentials. Now bloggers, thanks to the new [Connect Plugin Directory,](http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Facebook_Connect_Plugin_Directory) have a simple way to integrate Connect on their own sites and socialize more with their readers.

[Movable Type bloggers](http://plugins.movabletype.org/facebook-connect-commenters/) got a free plugin that allows any Facebook user to sign in, comment and share their action on a certain site on Facebook. This plugin will also automatically display users&#8217; Facebook photos in one&#8217;s comment and can share their comment via the social network&#8217;s newsfeed.

In a similar way to Movable Type, [WordPress bloggers](http://www.sociable.es/facebook-connect/) got a plugin that offers the same commenting possibilities but can also show recent visitors and allow readers to invite friends and share comments. Bloggers that use the [Disqus](http://blog.disqus.net/2008/12/16/disqus-and-facebook-connect/) commenting system will also be able to integrate Facebook Connect by the end of the year.

Facebook Connect seems to have a good effect on the number of comments a blog can receive.

Google and MySpace offer similar programs to Facebook&#8217;s Connect also. Google&#8217;s [Friend Connect](http://www.google.com/friendconnect/) allows users to sign in with their Google, Yahoo, AIM or OpenID account and interact with other visitors by making friends, sharing media or posting comments. The [MySpaceID](http://developer.myspace.com/Community/blogs/devteam/archive/2008/12/09/introducing-the-myspace-open-platform-and-myspaceid.aspx) program works on the same basis and allows users to publish and syndicate their activities to and from partner sites.
