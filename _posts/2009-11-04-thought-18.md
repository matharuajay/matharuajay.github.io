> &#8220;When you paint success pictures in your mind, you initiate an inner process whereby your attitudes, hopes, aspirations, and enthusiasm are elevated in response to an image of a more promising future. Every person who aspires must first sell themselves hope, the promise of a better life.&#8221;

You CAN make today a better day! First paint the picture, then go out and take the action necessary to achieve it!
