How do you let people create user accounts or post comments on your Web site without letting spam bots in? Simple &#8212; make your users prove they&#8217;re human. Many Web sites use <a href="https://www.captcha.net/" target="_blank">CAPTCHA</a> (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) technology to try to tell the bots from the people.

CAPTCHA&#8217;s idea is simple enough. It presents users with an image showing an obfuscated string of letters that they must type in to get an e-mail or social networking account, for instance, or to enter a comment on an online forum. The theory is that only humans can decipher the letters hidden in the image and type in the correct code, and for a time it was an effective tool to keep the bots out.

But while no one has yet come up with a computer that can fool people into thinking it&#8217;s another person, computers are great at fooling other computers. These days, malware makers and spammers regularly trick the CAPTCHA systems at big-name Web sites such as Yahoo Mail, Gmail and Craigslist, and use these sites to automate their attacks.
