Hey, I have this hilarious video of you dancing. Your face is so red. You should check it out.

If you&#8217;ve received a message like that through Facebook or MySpace, you may have been exposed to the &#8220;Koobface&#8221; virus. &#8220;Koobface&#8221; comes through an e-mail sent by one of your social networking site friends inviting you to scope out a video.

Once the URL is clicked, &#8220;Koobface&#8221; prompts you to update your Flash player before the video can be displayed. Therein lies the virus, cloaked in a &#8220;flash_player.exe&#8221; file. According to the Kaspersky Lab, an antivirus organization working closely with Facebook, &#8220;the worms transform victim machines into zombie computers to form botnets.&#8221;

The McAfee Security Blog explains that when &#8220;Koobface&#8221; infects your computer, it prompts a downloaded service named Security Accounts Manager (SamSs) to load on start-up. SamSs then proxies all HTTP traffic, stealing results from popular search engines and hijacking them to lesser-known search sites.

A clear eye for fraud will help you avoid this mess. You can usually spot phony e-mails by their titles. Kaspersky found the following: Paris Hilton Tosses Dwarf On The Street; Examiners Caught Downloading Grades From The Internet; You must see it!!! LOL. My friend catched you on hidden cam; Is it really celebrity? Funny Moments. My own &#8220;Koobface&#8221; attack came in an e-mail entitled, lool, yoour blushingg afce is so funny! Checkk out. Obviously, Paris Hilton never threw dwarves, and in all likelihood, my 26-year-old friend knows how to spell more than two words. These are clear indicators you&#8217;re being attacked.

Facebook has posted instructions about how to remove the &#8220;Koobface&#8221; virus: give your computer an antivirus scrub-down and change your Facebook password.

This attack on the world&#8217;s most popular social networking site and its 120 million users comes just weeks after Facebook won an $873 million lawsuit against several people accused of hacking user accounts and spreading spam.
