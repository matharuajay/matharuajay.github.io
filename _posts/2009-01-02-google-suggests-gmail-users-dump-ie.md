<div>
  Google Inc. is pushing users of its GmailÂ  e-mail service to dump Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Internet Explorer for its own Chrome browser or Mozilla Corp.&#8217;s Firefox.
</div>

When users of IE6 reach Gmail.com, a &#8220;Get faster Gmail&#8221; message appears in the Web-based service&#8217;s menu bar. The message, in turn, links to a page on Google&#8217;s Web site that touts Chrome and Firefox 3 as being &#8220;twice as fast&#8221; at running Gmail.

Last week, the Gmail site also displayed the message to users browsing with Microsoft&#8217;s IE7, but Google has since discarded that version of the notice. Users running other browsers, including Apple Inc.&#8217;s Safari and Opera Software ASA&#8217;s namesake browser, haven&#8217;t been shown the speed-up message.

Google currently lists IE7, Firefox 2.0 and later releases, Chrome and Safari as the only supported browsers for Gmail . Others, including Opera and older editions of IE, Firefox and Safari, can be used to access the e-mail service but aren&#8217;t able to handle some of its features.

More than 21% of users who browsed the Internet last month ran IE6, according to Web metrics company Net Applications Inc. IE7, meanwhile, accounted for about 48% of the browser market during November, with Firefox 3 in third place with nearly 16%.

Google has been aggressively marketing Chrome since it stripped the browser of its beta label earlier this month. A day later, for example, Google dropped Firefox as the default browser bundled with Google Pack application bundle and added Chrome in its place.

Google, Mozilla and WebKit &#8212; the open-source project that provides the engine for Apple&#8217;s Safari &#8212; have spent much of the second half of this year trumpeting JavaScript performance improvements , a necessary move, they say, to make Gmail and other Web applications run at speeds similar to that of traditional desktop software.
