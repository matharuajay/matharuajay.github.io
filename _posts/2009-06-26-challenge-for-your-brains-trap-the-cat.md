This is quite difficult but can be done.
  
Please do not blame me if you get no work done today&#8230;. or your catnap.. this is addictive&#8230;.

Try to encircle the cat, without letting it get out! Start by clicking on the image then on the light green dots to try to trap it with dark green dots. Not easy, it&#8217;s a smart cat.
