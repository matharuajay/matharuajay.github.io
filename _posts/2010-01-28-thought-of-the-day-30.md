A lot of times people look for the &#8220;Big Wins&#8221;. They go swinging for the Home Runs and look for the Big Ticket items. In many cases, the small things are what really matters! Take time to say, &#8220;Thank You&#8221;. Smile. Appreciate the things you have. Help someone out who needs it, even if they are not looking for assistance. These Acts of Kindness will be more effective than the big things.
