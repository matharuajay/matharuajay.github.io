As the Health Ministry prepares to enforce a &#8216;smoke-free workplace policy&#8217; from October 2, a petition challening the ban is up for hearing on September 30

The rule says;

&#8211; No person smokes in work places, shopping malls, and cinema theatres.

&#8211; Public spaces have to specifically display a board statingÂ  &#8216;No smoking area &#8211; smoking here is an offence&#8217; in English and other Indian Languages. Separate boards to be displayed at every entrance/floor.

&#8211; No ashtrays, matches, lighters to be provided in work places, shopping malls and cinema theatres.

&#8211; If owners fail to penalise smokers, they have to pay up fines equal to number of offences. The fine is Rs200 for each individual offence, but there&#8217;s a move to raise that to Rs1,000

Now the question is WILL WE GET SMOKE FREE WORKPLACES?
